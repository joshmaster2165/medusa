title: Tool Missing Description
category: tool_poisoning
severity: medium
description: >
  Flags MCP tools that have an empty or missing description field.
  Without a description, users and language models cannot understand
  what a tool does before invoking it, which prevents informed consent
  and increases the risk of unintended actions.
risk_explanation: >
  A tool with no description is a blind spot. The LLM may still invoke
  the tool based on its name alone, but cannot accurately assess its
  purpose or side effects. This undermines human-in-the-loop review and
  makes it easier for malicious tools to go unnoticed.
remediation: >
  Add a clear, concise description to every tool. The description should
  explain what the tool does, what inputs it expects, and what side effects
  it has. Keep descriptions under 2000 characters.
