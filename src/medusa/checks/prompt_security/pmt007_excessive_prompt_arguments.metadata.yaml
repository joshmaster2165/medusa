title: Excessive Prompt Arguments
category: prompt_security
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP prompt definitions that accept an excessive number of
  arguments, creating a large attack surface for injection through any
  of the argument slots. Prompts with many arguments are harder to
  validate and more likely to have overlooked injection vectors.
risk_explanation: >
  Each prompt argument is a potential injection vector. Prompts with
  many arguments increase the probability that at least one argument
  lacks proper validation. Complex argument schemas are difficult to
  audit and test comprehensively. Excessive arguments also increase the
  total user-controlled content in the prompt, making injection payloads
  easier to disguise among legitimate values.
remediation: >
  Limit the number of arguments per prompt to the minimum necessary.
  Consolidate related arguments into structured objects with schemas.
  Implement strict validation for every argument regardless of count.
  Review prompts with many arguments for potential simplification. Set a
  configurable maximum argument count policy.
