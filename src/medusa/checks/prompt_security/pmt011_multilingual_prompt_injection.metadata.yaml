title: Multilingual Prompt Injection
category: prompt_security
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP prompt arguments and definitions that use non-English
  languages, Unicode homoglyphs, or mixed-script text to bypass
  injection detection filters. Injection payloads in alternative
  languages or scripts may evade English-centric security filters.
risk_explanation: >
  Multilingual injection exploits the fact that most security filters
  are trained on English-language injection patterns. Payloads written
  in other languages, using Unicode homoglyphs that visually resemble
  ASCII characters, or mixing multiple scripts can bypass pattern-based
  detection while still being understood by multilingual LLMs. This
  creates a significant blind spot in prompt security defenses.
remediation: >
  Implement multilingual injection detection that covers major languages
  used by the target LLM. Normalize Unicode text to a canonical form
  before applying security filters. Detect and flag mixed-script text
  and homoglyph usage. Use semantic analysis rather than pattern
  matching alone for injection detection. Maintain injection pattern
  databases in multiple languages.
