title: Prompt Metadata Leakage
category: prompt_security
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP prompt definitions that expose sensitive metadata such as
  internal system names, author information, version details, internal
  identifiers, or development comments in their descriptions or argument
  definitions visible to clients.
risk_explanation: >
  Metadata leaked through prompt definitions provides attackers with
  intelligence about the server internal structure, development
  practices, and configuration. Internal system names can identify
  backend services to target. Version information enables CVE targeting.
  Development comments may reveal security assumptions or known
  limitations that can be exploited.
remediation: >
  Review all prompt definitions for sensitive metadata before
  deployment. Remove internal comments, system identifiers, version
  numbers, and developer notes from client-visible prompt descriptions
  and argument definitions. Implement a pre-deployment review process
  that strips metadata. Use separate internal and external description
  fields for prompts.
