title: Prompt Output Manipulation
category: prompt_security
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP prompt definitions that can be manipulated to control or
  redirect the LLM output format, destination, or content in ways
  unintended by the prompt designer. Output manipulation enables data
  exfiltration, instruction injection into downstream systems, and
  evasion of output filters.
risk_explanation: >
  Output manipulation allows attackers to use prompts as a conduit to
  control what the LLM produces and where it sends results. Manipulated
  output can include encoded data exfiltration payloads, instructions
  that target downstream tool invocations, or formatted content that
  bypasses output content filters. This turns the prompt into an
  indirect attack vector against the entire LLM application.
remediation: >
  Implement output validation that checks LLM responses against expected
  formats and content policies. Define output schemas for prompts and
  validate generated content. Filter output for injection patterns
  before it reaches downstream tools or users. Monitor for anomalous
  output patterns that may indicate manipulation.
