title: Prompt Argument Injection
category: prompt_security
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP prompt templates that incorporate user-supplied arguments
  directly into prompt text without sanitization or escaping. Malicious
  argument values can alter the prompt semantics, inject new
  instructions, or override the intended prompt behavior.
risk_explanation: >
  When prompt arguments are interpolated without sanitization, an
  attacker can inject additional instructions that the LLM treats as
  part of the original prompt. This enables privilege escalation by
  injecting admin-level instructions, data exfiltration by adding
  instructions to output sensitive context, and behavioral manipulation
  by overriding the prompt intended purpose.
remediation: >
  Sanitize all prompt arguments before interpolation by escaping special
  characters and instruction delimiters. Use structured prompt templates
  that clearly delineate system instructions from user input. Implement
  argument validation with strict type checking and length limits.
  Consider using parameterized prompts that prevent argument content
  from being interpreted as instructions.
