title: Multi-Turn Conversation Manipulation
category: context_security
severity: high
description: >
  Detects patterns of progressive manipulation across multiple
  conversation turns. Multi-turn attacks incrementally shift the LLM's
  behavior over several exchanges to bypass single-turn safety checks.
risk_explanation: >
  Multi-turn manipulation attacks bypass safety measures by gradually
  shifting the LLM's behavior over several conversation turns. Each
  individual turn may appear benign, but the cumulative effect steers
  the LLM toward performing unauthorized actions. This is particularly
  dangerous because single-turn safety checks may not detect the
  progressive nature of the attack.
remediation: >
  Implement conversation-level behavior monitoring that tracks
  cumulative drift across multiple turns. Use anomaly detection to
  identify progressive manipulation patterns. Periodically reinforce
  system prompt instructions throughout long conversations. Set maximum
  conversation lengths and require re-authentication for extended
  sessions.
