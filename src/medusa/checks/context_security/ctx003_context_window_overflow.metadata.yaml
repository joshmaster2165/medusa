title: Context Window Overflow Attack
category: context_security
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP tool outputs or resource contents designed to flood the
  LLM context window with excessive data. Context window overflow
  attacks push legitimate instructions out of the context, causing the
  LLM to lose track of its original directives.
risk_explanation: >
  By filling the LLM's context window with large volumes of irrelevant
  or adversarial content, an attacker can push the system prompt and
  earlier safety instructions out of the active context. This causes the
  LLM to lose its behavioral guardrails, making it susceptible to
  following attacker-provided instructions embedded in the overflow
  content.
remediation: >
  Implement output size limits for all MCP tools and resources. Truncate
  or paginate large responses before they enter the LLM context. Monitor
  the total context utilisation and alert when a single tool response
  consumes a disproportionate share of the context window. Use
  summarization for large data returns.
