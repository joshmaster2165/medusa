title: Cross-Conversation Context Contamination
category: context_security
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server implementations that allow data from one
  conversation session to leak into another. Cross-conversation
  contamination violates session isolation and exposes user data.
risk_explanation: >
  When data from one user's conversation leaks into another user's
  session, private information, tool invocation results, and
  conversation context are exposed to unauthorized parties. This can
  occur through shared caches, persistent state, or improper session
  management in the MCP server.
remediation: >
  Implement strict session isolation in the MCP server. Use separate
  state stores for each conversation session and clear all session data
  when a conversation ends. Avoid shared caches that span sessions.
  Validate session boundaries in all tool invocations and resource
  accesses. Conduct regular testing for cross-session data leakage.
