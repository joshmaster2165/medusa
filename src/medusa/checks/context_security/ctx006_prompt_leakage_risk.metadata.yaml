title: System Prompt Leakage Risk
category: context_security
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP tool behaviors or output patterns that could cause the LLM
  to reveal its system prompt or internal instructions. System prompt
  leakage exposes security controls and business logic.
risk_explanation: >
  System prompts contain security directives, behavioral constraints,
  and business logic that should remain confidential. If a tool can
  trick the LLM into revealing its system prompt, attackers learn the
  exact safety measures in place and can craft targeted bypass
  techniques. This is often the first step in a more sophisticated
  attack chain.
remediation: >
  Implement system prompt protection that prevents the LLM from
  including system prompt content in responses. Filter tool outputs for
  content that could elicit prompt disclosure. Add explicit system
  prompt protection directives. Monitor for prompt leakage attempts and
  alert on suspicious extraction patterns.
