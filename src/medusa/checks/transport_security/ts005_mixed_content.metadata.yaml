title: Mixed Content Transport
category: transport_security
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that mix HTTP and HTTPS connections in their
  transport configuration. Mixed content downgrades the security of the
  entire communication channel, as any unencrypted connection can be
  intercepted to steal credentials or modify traffic.
risk_explanation: >
  Mixed content transport allows a network attacker to intercept the
  unencrypted HTTP connections while the user believes the session is
  secure due to the HTTPS connections. The attacker can steal tokens
  transmitted over HTTP, inject malicious content, or downgrade the
  entire session to plaintext. A single HTTP request is sufficient to
  compromise authentication credentials.
remediation: >
  Ensure all MCP server connections use HTTPS exclusively. Configure
  HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects for any endpoints that still accept HTTP.
  Implement HSTS to prevent protocol downgrade attacks. Audit all
  connection URLs in server configuration for http:// references and
  update them to https://.
