title: Missing Certificate Transparency
category: transport_security
severity: low
description: >
  Detects absence of Certificate Transparency (CT) log monitoring for
  MCP server certificates. Without CT monitoring, unauthorized
  certificate issuance for the server's domain goes undetected, enabling
  unnoticed man-in-the-middle attacks.
risk_explanation: >
  Certificate Transparency logs provide a public, auditable record of
  all certificates issued for a domain. Without CT monitoring, a
  certificate authority can issue a certificate for the server's domain
  to an attacker without detection. The attacker uses this certificate
  for MITM attacks that pass standard certificate validation. CT
  monitoring is the primary mechanism for detecting unauthorized
  certificate issuance.
remediation: >
  Implement Certificate Transparency monitoring for all domains used by
  MCP servers. Use CT monitoring services (e.g. crt.sh, Facebook CT
  Monitor, SSLMate Cert Spotter) to receive alerts on new certificate
  issuance. Configure Expect-CT headers on server responses. Require SCT
  (Signed Certificate Timestamp) inclusion in server certificates.
