title: Insecure TLS Configuration
category: transport_security
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects configuration specifying deprecated TLS versions such as SSLv2,
  SSLv3, TLS 1.0, or TLS 1.1. These protocols have known vulnerabilities
  (POODLE, BEAST, etc.) and should not be used.
risk_explanation: >
  Deprecated TLS versions contain cryptographic weaknesses that allow
  attackers to decrypt traffic or downgrade the connection security. Modern
  applications should use TLS 1.2 or 1.3 exclusively.
remediation: >
  Update TLS configuration to use TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 as the minimum
  version. Remove any references to SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS 1.0, or TLS 1.1
  from configuration files and environment variables.
