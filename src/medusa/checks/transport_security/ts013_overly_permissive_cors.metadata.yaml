title: Overly Permissive CORS
category: transport_security
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP servers with CORS configuration that allows all origins
  (Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *) or reflects the request origin.
  Overly permissive CORS enables any website to make authenticated
  requests to the MCP server.
risk_explanation: >
  CORS with Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * allows any website to make
  cross-origin requests to the MCP server. When combined with Access-
  Control-Allow-Credentials: true, any malicious website can make
  authenticated requests using the user's cookies. The attacker's
  website can invoke MCP tools, read responses, and exfiltrate data
  through the user's authenticated session.
remediation: >
  Restrict Access-Control-Allow-Origin to specific trusted domains.
  Never use wildcards (*) for endpoints that accept authentication.
  Validate the Origin header against an allowlist before reflecting it.
  Do not combine Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * with Access-Control-
  Allow-Credentials: true.
