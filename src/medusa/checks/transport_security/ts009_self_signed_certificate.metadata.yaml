title: Self-Signed Certificate Usage
category: transport_security
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP servers using self-signed TLS certificates. Self-signed
  certificates cannot be verified against a trusted certificate
  authority chain, requiring clients to disable certificate validation
  and making them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
risk_explanation: >
  Self-signed certificates force clients to either reject the connection
  or disable certificate validation. When validation is disabled, any
  attacker can present their own self-signed certificate and intercept
  the connection. Self-signed certificates provide encryption but no
  authentication, meaning the client cannot verify it is communicating
  with the intended server.
remediation: >
  Replace self-signed certificates with certificates from a trusted CA.
  Use Let's Encrypt for free automated certificate issuance. For
  internal services, establish a private CA and distribute its root
  certificate to clients. If self-signed certificates are temporarily
  required, implement certificate pinning to prevent MITM attacks.
