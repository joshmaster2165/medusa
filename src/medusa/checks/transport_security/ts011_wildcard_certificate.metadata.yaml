title: Wildcard Certificate Usage
category: transport_security
severity: low
description: >
  Detects MCP servers using wildcard TLS certificates (*.example.com).
  Wildcard certificates cover all subdomains, meaning a private key
  compromise on any subdomain's server exposes all subdomains to
  impersonation.
risk_explanation: >
  Wildcard certificates share a single private key across all
  subdomains. If the key is compromised on any server hosting any
  subdomain, the attacker can impersonate every subdomain. This is
  especially risky when the wildcard certificate is deployed to
  development, staging, and production servers, as the weakest server's
  security determines the entire domain's security.
remediation: >
  Use specific certificates for each subdomain or service instead of
  wildcard certificates. If wildcards are necessary, restrict their
  deployment to trusted servers with strong key protection. Use separate
  certificates for different security zones (production, staging,
  development). Implement key isolation using HSMs.
