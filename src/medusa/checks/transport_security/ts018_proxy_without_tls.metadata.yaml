title: Proxy Without TLS
category: transport_security
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server proxy configurations that do not use TLS
  encryption. Proxies without TLS decrypt and re-encrypt traffic,
  creating a plaintext exposure point. Unencrypted proxy connections
  expose all traffic to interception at the proxy hop.
risk_explanation: >
  An unencrypted proxy connection creates a plaintext segment in the
  communication path where all traffic, including authentication tokens
  and sensitive data, is exposed. Even if the origin and destination use
  HTTPS, an unencrypted proxy hop exposes the decrypted traffic to the
  proxy operator and any attacker who can intercept the proxy
  connection.
remediation: >
  Configure TLS encryption for all proxy connections (HTTPS proxy). Use
  CONNECT tunnelling for end-to-end encryption through proxies. Verify
  proxy certificate authenticity. Avoid HTTP proxy configurations in
  production environments. Implement proxy authentication to prevent
  unauthorized proxy usage.
