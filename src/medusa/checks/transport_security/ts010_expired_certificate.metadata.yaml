title: Expired TLS Certificate
category: transport_security
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP servers with expired TLS certificates. Expired
  certificates cause connection errors in properly configured clients
  and may lead administrators to disable certificate validation to
  restore service, removing all TLS authentication guarantees.
risk_explanation: >
  Expired certificates indicate a failure in certificate lifecycle
  management. Clients that accept expired certificates lose the
  guarantee that the certificate was issued to the legitimate server
  operator. The most dangerous consequence is that operators disable
  certificate validation to work around the expiration, leaving the
  connection vulnerable to interception indefinitely.
remediation: >
  Implement automated certificate renewal using ACME (Let's Encrypt) or
  certificate management platforms. Set up monitoring and alerting for
  certificate expiration at least 30 days before expiry. Use certificate
  management tools that automatically rotate certificates. Never disable
  certificate validation to work around expired certificates.
