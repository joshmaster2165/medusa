title: Unencrypted Transport
category: transport_security
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP servers using plain HTTP instead of HTTPS for their transport
  layer. Unencrypted transport exposes all tool calls, responses, and
  credentials to network-level interception and man-in-the-middle attacks.
risk_explanation: >
  Without TLS encryption, any network observer (ISP, shared WiFi, compromised
  router) can read and modify MCP traffic in transit. This includes tool
  invocations, their parameters, returned data, and authentication tokens.
remediation: >
  Switch all MCP server transport URLs from http:// to https://. Ensure TLS
  certificates are valid and up to date. If the server is in development,
  use a self-signed certificate or a local CA for testing.
