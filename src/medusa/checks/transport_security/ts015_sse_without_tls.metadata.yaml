title: SSE Without TLS
category: transport_security
severity: high
description: >
  Detects Server-Sent Events (SSE) connections over unencrypted HTTP.
  MCP servers using SSE transport over HTTP expose the event stream to
  network interception, including tool results, notifications, and
  potentially sensitive server-pushed data.
risk_explanation: >
  SSE connections over HTTP transmit server-pushed events in plaintext.
  Since SSE is a primary MCP transport mechanism, unencrypted SSE
  exposes the entire server-to-client communication channel. A network
  observer can read all tool execution results, resource updates, and
  notification content. The long-lived nature of SSE connections
  provides persistent visibility into server operations.
remediation: >
  Configure all SSE endpoints to require HTTPS. Use TLS-encrypted
  connections for the SSE event stream. Implement the same security
  headers (HSTS, CSP) on SSE endpoints as on regular HTTPS endpoints.
  Reject unencrypted HTTP connections to SSE endpoints.
