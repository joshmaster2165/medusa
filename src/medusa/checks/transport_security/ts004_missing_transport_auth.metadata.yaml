title: Missing Transport Authentication Headers
category: transport_security
severity: high
description: >
  Detects HTTP/SSE MCP servers that lack authentication headers such as
  Authorization or X-API-Key in their transport configuration. Without
  transport-layer authentication headers, requests are sent unauthenticated.
risk_explanation: >
  Missing authentication headers mean that the MCP server accepts requests
  from any client that can reach it over the network. This can lead to
  unauthorized tool invocation and data access.
remediation: >
  Add an Authorization header (e.g. Bearer token) or X-API-Key header to
  the server's transport configuration. Use strong, unique tokens and
  rotate them regularly.
