title: Certificate Pinning Absent
category: transport_security
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP connections without certificate pinning for critical
  communication channels. Without pinning, any certificate authority can
  issue a certificate for the server's domain, enabling man-in-the-
  middle attacks by compromised or coerced CAs.
risk_explanation: >
  Without certificate pinning, an attacker who compromises any trusted
  certificate authority (or obtains a misissued certificate) can
  intercept TLS connections to the MCP server. There are hundreds of
  trusted CAs, and several have been compromised historically. Pinning
  restricts accepted certificates to a known set, mitigating CA
  compromise.
remediation: >
  Implement certificate pinning for connections to critical MCP servers.
  Pin the server's public key or a trusted intermediate CA certificate.
  Use HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) headers or application-level
  pinning. Maintain backup pins for key rotation. Monitor Certificate
  Transparency logs for unauthorized certificate issuance.
