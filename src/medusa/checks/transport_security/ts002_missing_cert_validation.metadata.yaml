title: Missing Certificate Validation
category: transport_security
severity: high
description: >
  Detects configuration that disables TLS certificate verification (e.g.
  NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0, verify=false). Even when HTTPS is used,
  disabled cert validation allows man-in-the-middle attacks.
risk_explanation: >
  Disabling certificate validation means the client will accept any
  certificate, including self-signed or attacker-controlled ones. An attacker
  on the network can intercept, read, and modify all encrypted traffic.
remediation: >
  Remove any configuration that disables certificate validation. Ensure
  NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED is not set to 0, verify/ssl_verify is not
  set to false, and GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY is not set. Use proper CA certificates
  instead of disabling validation.
