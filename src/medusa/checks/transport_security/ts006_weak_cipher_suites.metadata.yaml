title: Weak TLS Cipher Suites
category: transport_security
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP servers configured with weak or deprecated TLS cipher
  suites. Weak ciphers such as RC4, DES, 3DES, and export-grade ciphers
  can be broken by modern attacks, compromising the confidentiality of
  encrypted communications.
risk_explanation: >
  Weak cipher suites allow an attacker to decrypt TLS-encrypted traffic
  through known cryptographic attacks. RC4 has practical biases enabling
  plaintext recovery, DES and 3DES are vulnerable to Sweet32 attacks,
  and export ciphers use intentionally weakened key sizes. Servers
  supporting weak ciphers are vulnerable even if they also support
  strong ciphers due to downgrade attacks.
remediation: >
  Configure TLS to use only strong cipher suites. Prefer AEAD ciphers
  (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305). Disable all CBC-mode ciphers, RC4, DES,
  3DES, and export ciphers. Set TLS minimum version to 1.2, preferring
  TLS 1.3 which eliminates weak cipher negotiation. Use tools like
  testssl.sh to audit cipher configuration.
