title: Missing CORS Headers
category: transport_security
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects HTTP endpoints without Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
  configuration. Missing CORS headers can either block legitimate cross-
  origin requests or indicate that no cross-origin access policy has
  been considered, potentially defaulting to an insecure state.
risk_explanation: >
  Missing CORS configuration means the server has not explicitly defined
  which origins can access its resources. Without CORS headers, browsers
  block cross-origin requests by default, but server-side requests are
  not restricted. The lack of explicit CORS policy indicates missing
  security consideration for cross-origin access, which may lead to
  overly permissive configuration when CORS is eventually needed.
remediation: >
  Configure explicit CORS headers on all HTTP endpoints. Set Access-
  Control-Allow-Origin to specific trusted origins, never use wildcards
  for authenticated endpoints. Define allowed methods and headers
  explicitly. Implement CORS preflight caching with appropriate max-age
  values.
