title: Unsigned Server Updates
category: integrity
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server update mechanisms that do not verify cryptographic
  signatures on updates. Unsigned updates can be replaced with malicious
  payloads during transit or at the distribution point.
risk_explanation: >
  Without signature verification, an attacker who compromises the update
  distribution channel can serve malicious updates that are installed
  without question. This enables persistent compromise of the MCP server
  through a trusted update mechanism, which is particularly dangerous
  because updates are expected to change the server's behavior.
remediation: >
  Implement cryptographic signature verification for all server updates.
  Use code signing certificates from trusted certificate authorities.
  Verify signatures before applying updates and reject any update that
  fails verification. Distribute public keys through a separate,
  authenticated channel.
