title: Insecure Config File Permissions
category: integrity
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server configuration files with overly permissive file
  system permissions. World-readable or group-writable configuration
  files expose secrets and allow unauthorised modification.
risk_explanation: >
  Configuration files often contain sensitive information such as API
  keys, database credentials, and server secrets. World-readable
  permissions allow any user on the system to read these secrets, while
  group-writable or world-writable permissions allow unauthorised
  modification of the server's configuration, potentially disabling
  security controls or redirecting data flows.
remediation: >
  Set configuration file permissions to owner-only read/write (600) or
  owner-read with group-read (640) at most. Ensure the configuration
  file is owned by the MCP server's service account. Use file integrity
  monitoring to detect unauthorised permission changes. Store sensitive
  configuration values in a secrets manager rather than flat files.
