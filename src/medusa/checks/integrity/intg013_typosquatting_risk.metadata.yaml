title: Typosquatting Risk
category: integrity
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server dependencies with names that closely resemble
  popular packages, indicating potential typosquatting. Typosquatting
  packages contain malicious code disguised as legitimate libraries.
risk_explanation: >
  Typosquatting exploits common typing mistakes to trick developers into
  installing malicious packages. Packages with names like "reqeusts"
  instead of "requests" or "lodsah" instead of "lodash" contain
  malicious code that executes during installation or import. A single
  misspelled dependency in an MCP server configuration compromises the
  entire host.
remediation: >
  Verify all dependency names against official package registries before
  installation. Use typosquatting detection tools in CI pipelines. Pin
  dependencies by exact version and hash. Review dependency changes
  carefully in code review, paying special attention to new package
  additions.
