title: Unsigned Server Binaries
category: integrity
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP servers running local scripts (e.g. node script.js, python
  script.py) without any integrity verification mechanism configured in the
  server configuration. Without hash or signature checks, a tampered script
  will be executed without detection.
risk_explanation: >
  When an MCP server is launched by running a local script file, any
  modification to that file—whether by malware, a compromised CI/CD
  pipeline, or an insider threat—will go undetected. Without integrity
  verification (checksums, code signatures, or hash pinning), the host
  blindly trusts whatever code is present at launch time.
remediation: >
  Add integrity verification to your MCP server configuration. Include a
  sha256 hash, checksum, or signature field that is validated before the
  server process starts. Consider using code signing for server binaries
  and scripts. Store integrity baselines in a separate, protected
  configuration file.
