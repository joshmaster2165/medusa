title: Unverified Server Identity
category: integrity
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that do not provide proper identity information in
  their server_info response. A server that lacks a name or version in its
  identity metadata cannot be reliably distinguished from impostor servers.
risk_explanation: >
  The MCP protocol allows servers to declare their identity via the
  server_info field during initialization. When this field is missing or
  incomplete, clients and users cannot verify they are communicating with
  the intended server. An attacker running a shadow server can trivially
  impersonate a legitimate server that does not assert its identity.
remediation: >
  Ensure your MCP server returns complete server_info during initialization,
  including at minimum a non-empty name and version string. Use the name
  field to clearly identify the server and the version field to enable
  clients to detect unexpected changes. Consider implementing server
  identity verification at the client level.
