title: Missing Reproducible Build
category: integrity
severity: medium
description: >
  Checks whether the MCP server can be built reproducibly from source.
  Without reproducible builds, there is no way to verify that the
  distributed binary matches the published source code.
risk_explanation: >
  Without reproducible builds, users must trust that the distributed
  binary was built from the published source code. An attacker who
  compromises the build system can inject malicious code that does not
  appear in the source repository. Reproducible builds allow independent
  verification that the binary matches the source.
remediation: >
  Configure the build system to produce reproducible outputs. Pin all
  build dependencies and toolchain versions. Remove sources of non-
  determinism such as timestamps, random values, and filesystem
  ordering. Document the build process and provide instructions for
  independent verification.
