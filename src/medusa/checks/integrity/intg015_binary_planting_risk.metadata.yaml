title: Binary Planting Risk
category: integrity
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server configurations vulnerable to binary planting
  attacks where executable search path manipulation causes a malicious
  binary to be executed instead of the intended one.
risk_explanation: >
  Binary planting (also known as DLL hijacking or PATH manipulation)
  exploits the way operating systems search for executables. If the MCP
  server's startup command does not use an absolute path, an attacker
  who can write to a directory in the search path can place a malicious
  binary that gets executed with the server's privileges.
remediation: >
  Use absolute paths for all executable references in MCP server
  configurations. Restrict the PATH environment variable to trusted
  directories only. Verify executable integrity before launch using
  checksums or code signatures. Avoid using relative paths or relying on
  system PATH resolution for security-critical binaries.
