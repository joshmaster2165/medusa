title: Missing Software Bill of Materials
category: integrity
severity: medium
description: >
  Checks whether the MCP server provides a Software Bill of Materials
  (SBOM). An SBOM lists all components and dependencies, enabling supply
  chain transparency and vulnerability tracking.
risk_explanation: >
  Without an SBOM, it is impossible to quickly determine whether the MCP
  server is affected by newly disclosed vulnerabilities. When a critical
  CVE is announced, organisations without SBOMs must manually audit each
  server's dependencies, delaying incident response and leaving
  vulnerable systems exposed.
remediation: >
  Generate an SBOM in a standard format (SPDX or CycloneDX) for the MCP
  server. Include the SBOM in the server's distribution package and
  update it with each release. Use automated SBOM generation tools
  integrated into the build pipeline. Regularly scan the SBOM against
  vulnerability databases.
