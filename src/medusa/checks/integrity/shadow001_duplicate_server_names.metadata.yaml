title: Generic or Duplicate-Prone Server Name
category: integrity
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP servers using generic, short, or commonly duplicated names
  that make it easy for a malicious server to masquerade as a legitimate
  one. Generic names like "server", "test", or "mcp" provide no meaningful
  identity and increase the risk of server shadowing attacks.
risk_explanation: >
  When multiple MCP servers share generic names, an attacker can register a
  shadow server with the same name. The LLM or client may route requests to
  the malicious server instead of the legitimate one, enabling data
  exfiltration, tool poisoning, or privilege escalation. Short or generic
  names also make it harder for users to distinguish between servers during
  consent and audit flows.
remediation: >
  Use unique, descriptive server names that clearly identify the server's
  purpose and owner (e.g. "acme-corp-billing-api" instead of "server").
  Server names should be at least 3 characters long and avoid common
  generic terms. Consider using a naming convention that includes the
  organisation, service, and environment.
