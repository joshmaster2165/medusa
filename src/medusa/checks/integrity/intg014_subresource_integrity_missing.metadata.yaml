title: Missing Subresource Integrity
category: integrity
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that load remote resources (scripts, stylesheets,
  data files) without Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes. Without SRI,
  tampered remote resources are loaded without detection.
risk_explanation: >
  Remote resources loaded without SRI hashes can be silently replaced
  with malicious content if the hosting CDN or server is compromised.
  The MCP server would load and execute the tampered content without any
  integrity check, enabling supply-chain attacks through compromised
  third-party resources.
remediation: >
  Add integrity attributes with cryptographic hashes (SHA-256 or
  stronger) for all remotely loaded resources. Implement Content
  Security Policy headers that require SRI for scripts and stylesheets.
  Automate SRI hash generation and verification as part of the build and
  deployment process.
