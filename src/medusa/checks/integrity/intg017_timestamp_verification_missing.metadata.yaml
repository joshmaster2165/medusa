title: Missing Timestamp Verification
category: integrity
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects signed artifacts that lack timestamp verification. Without
  trusted timestamps, signatures remain valid even after the signing key
  has been compromised or revoked.
risk_explanation: >
  Without timestamp verification, a signature made with a compromised
  key cannot be distinguished from a legitimate signature made before
  the compromise. Timestamp authorities provide proof that a signature
  was created at a specific time, allowing revocation of signatures made
  after key compromise while preserving the validity of earlier
  signatures.
remediation: >
  Include RFC 3161 timestamp tokens in all code signatures. Use trusted
  timestamp authorities and verify timestamps during signature
  validation. Implement timestamp-based revocation checking that
  invalidates signatures created after key compromise events. Configure
  signature verification to reject artifacts without valid timestamps.
