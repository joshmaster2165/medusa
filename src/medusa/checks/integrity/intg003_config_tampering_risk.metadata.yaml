title: Configuration Stored in World-Writable Path
category: integrity
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server configurations stored in world-writable or temporary
  directories such as /tmp, /var/tmp, or platform-specific temp folders.
  Configurations in these locations can be modified by any local user or
  process, enabling config tampering attacks.
risk_explanation: >
  When an MCP server's configuration file resides in a world-writable
  directory, any local user or malicious process can modify it. An attacker
  could change the server command, inject environment variables containing
  secrets, or redirect the transport URL to a malicious endpoint—all without
  requiring elevated privileges.
remediation: >
  Store MCP server configuration files in user-owned directories with
  restrictive permissions (e.g. ~/.config/mcp/ with mode 700). Avoid
  placing configuration in /tmp, /var/tmp, or other shared temporary
  directories. Verify file ownership and permissions before reading
  configuration at startup.
