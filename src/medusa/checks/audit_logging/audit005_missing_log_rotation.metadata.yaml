title: Missing Log Rotation
category: audit_logging
severity: low
description: >
  Checks whether the MCP server has a log rotation policy configured.
  Without log rotation, log files grow unbounded, eventually exhausting
  disk space and causing service disruption.
risk_explanation: >
  Without log rotation, log files grow indefinitely and can exhaust
  available disk space, causing the MCP server or the entire host to
  fail. Additionally, excessively large log files are difficult to
  search and analyze during incident response, reducing the
  effectiveness of security investigations.
remediation: >
  Configure log rotation based on file size and time intervals. Use
  logrotate or equivalent tools to automatically rotate, compress, and
  archive old log files. Set a maximum retention period aligned with the
  organisation's data retention policy. Monitor disk usage for log
  directories.
