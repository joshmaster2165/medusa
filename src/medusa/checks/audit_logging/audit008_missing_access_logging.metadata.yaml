title: Missing Access Logging
category: audit_logging
severity: medium
description: >
  Checks whether the MCP server logs resource access events. Without
  access logging, there is no record of which resources were accessed,
  by whom, or when.
risk_explanation: >
  Without access logging, unauthorized data access leaves no trace.
  Security teams cannot detect data exfiltration, identify compromised
  accounts accessing sensitive resources, or demonstrate compliance with
  access control requirements during audits. Access logs are essential
  for detecting insider threats and external intrusions.
remediation: >
  Log all resource access events including the resource identifier, the
  accessor's identity, the access type (read/write/delete), the
  timestamp, and the outcome (success/failure). Implement access log
  analysis to detect anomalous access patterns. Retain access logs for
  the period required by applicable regulations and security policies.
