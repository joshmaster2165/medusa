title: Missing Forensic Capability
category: audit_logging
severity: medium
description: >
  Checks whether the MCP server's logging and data retention provide
  sufficient information for security forensic investigations.
  Incomplete forensic data prevents root cause analysis after security
  incidents.
risk_explanation: >
  After a security incident, forensic investigators need detailed data
  to determine the attack vector, scope of compromise, data accessed,
  and timeline of events. Without sufficient forensic capability,
  organizations cannot determine the root cause, assess the full impact,
  or implement effective countermeasures to prevent recurrence.
remediation: >
  Ensure logging captures sufficient detail for forensic analysis
  including full request/response payloads for sensitive operations,
  network connection metadata, process execution details, and file
  access events. Implement log correlation across MCP components.
  Maintain log retention for a minimum period required for forensic
  investigations (typically 90 days to 1 year).
