title: Sensitive Data in Logs
category: audit_logging
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server logging configurations or patterns that write
  sensitive data such as PII, credentials, or API keys to log files.
  Sensitive data in logs creates secondary exposure vectors.
risk_explanation: >
  Log files are frequently stored with less restrictive access controls
  than primary data stores and are often aggregated in third-party
  logging platforms. Credentials in logs can be used for lateral
  movement, PII in logs violates privacy regulations, and API keys in
  logs can be exploited for unauthorized access to external services.
remediation: >
  Implement log scrubbing that automatically detects and redacts
  sensitive data patterns (API keys, passwords, SSNs, credit card
  numbers) before writing to logs. Use structured logging with explicit
  field allow-lists. Configure log frameworks to mask sensitive
  parameter values. Regularly audit log output for sensitive data
  leakage.
