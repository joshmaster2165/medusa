title: Insufficient Log Detail
category: audit_logging
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server logging configurations that lack essential detail
  such as caller identity, tool invocation parameters, timestamps, or
  request correlation IDs. Incomplete logs hinder security
  investigations.
risk_explanation: >
  Logs without sufficient detail cannot support effective incident
  response. Missing caller identity prevents attribution of malicious
  actions, missing parameters prevent reconstruction of attack payloads,
  and missing correlation IDs prevent tracing of multi-step attacks
  across distributed components.
remediation: >
  Configure structured logging that includes caller identity, tool name,
  invocation parameters, timestamps, correlation IDs, and response
  status for every tool invocation. Use a logging framework that
  enforces a minimum set of required fields. Regularly audit log
  completeness.
