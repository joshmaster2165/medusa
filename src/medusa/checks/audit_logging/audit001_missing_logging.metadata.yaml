title: Missing Logging Configuration
category: audit_logging
severity: medium
description: >
  Checks whether the MCP server's configuration or environment variables
  include any logging or observability settings. Servers without logging
  configuration cannot produce audit trails for security investigations.
risk_explanation: >
  Without logging, malicious tool invocations, data exfiltration attempts,
  and prompt injection attacks leave no trace. Incident response teams
  cannot reconstruct attack timelines or determine the scope of a breach.
remediation: >
  Configure structured logging for the MCP server. Set a LOG_LEVEL
  environment variable and ensure logs are shipped to a centralised logging
  platform. Consider integrating OpenTelemetry or a similar observability
  framework.
