title: Log Tampering Risk
category: audit_logging
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server log storage configurations where logs are stored in
  writable locations without integrity protections. Attackers who
  compromise the server can modify or delete logs to cover their tracks.
risk_explanation: >
  If logs are stored in locations writable by the MCP server process, an
  attacker who compromises the server can delete or modify log entries
  to erase evidence of their activities. This defeats the purpose of
  audit logging and allows attackers to operate undetected for extended
  periods.
remediation: >
  Ship logs to a write-only remote destination that the MCP server
  cannot modify or delete. Use append-only log storage with
  cryptographic chaining to detect tampering. Implement log integrity
  verification using hash chains or digital signatures. Separate log
  storage permissions from the server's runtime permissions.
