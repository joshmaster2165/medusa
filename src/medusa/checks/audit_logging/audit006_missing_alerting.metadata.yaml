title: Missing Security Alerting
category: audit_logging
severity: medium
description: >
  Checks whether the MCP server has alerting configured for security-
  relevant events. Without alerting, security incidents are only
  discovered during manual log review, which may be too late.
risk_explanation: >
  Without automated alerting, security events such as repeated
  authentication failures, privilege escalation attempts, unusual data
  access patterns, or tool invocation anomalies go unnoticed until
  manual log review occurs. This delay gives attackers extended dwell
  time to achieve their objectives before detection.
remediation: >
  Configure automated alerts for security-relevant events including
  authentication failures, privilege escalation, anomalous tool
  invocations, and data access spikes. Use a SIEM or log aggregation
  platform with alerting capabilities. Define alert thresholds and
  escalation procedures. Test alerting regularly to ensure it functions
  correctly.
