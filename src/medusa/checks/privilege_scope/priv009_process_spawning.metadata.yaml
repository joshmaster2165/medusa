title: Unrestricted Process Spawning
category: privilege_scope
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that can spawn arbitrary processes without
  restrictions. Tools with unconstrained process execution capabilities
  allow running any command on the host system, effectively providing a
  remote shell.
risk_explanation: >
  Unrestricted process spawning is equivalent to remote code execution.
  An attacker can run any command on the host system, including reverse
  shells, cryptocurrency miners, data exfiltration scripts, and lateral
  movement tools. Process spawning is the most common path from tool
  invocation to full system compromise.
remediation: >
  Restrict process spawning to a predefined allowlist of safe commands.
  Use sandboxed execution environments for tool processes. Implement
  command-line argument validation and rejection of shell
  metacharacters. Run tools in isolated environments with restricted
  process capabilities (seccomp, AppArmor).
