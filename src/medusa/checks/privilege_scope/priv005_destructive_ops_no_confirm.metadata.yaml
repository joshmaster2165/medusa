title: Destructive Operations Without Confirmation
category: privilege_scope
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that perform destructive operations (delete, drop,
  truncate, purge, destroy) without requiring explicit user
  confirmation. Destructive operations executed without consent can
  cause irreversible data loss.
risk_explanation: >
  Destructive tools without confirmation gates can be triggered by
  prompt injection or LLM misinterpretation, causing permanent data
  loss. An attacker who manipulates the LLM can delete files, drop
  database tables, or destroy cloud resources without the user ever
  being asked to confirm. The lack of confirmation makes destructive
  operations indistinguishable from read operations in the invocation
  flow.
remediation: >
  Implement human-in-the-loop confirmation for all destructive
  operations. Use the MCP tool annotation destructiveHint=true to signal
  clients that confirmation is required. Add a confirmation parameter to
  destructive tools that requires a specific value. Implement soft-
  delete patterns with recovery windows instead of hard deletes.
