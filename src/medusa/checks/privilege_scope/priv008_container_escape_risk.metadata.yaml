title: Container Escape Risk
category: privilege_scope
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP tools with access to the host filesystem, Docker socket,
  or container runtime that could enable container escape. Tools that
  can mount host paths or communicate with the Docker daemon can break
  out of container isolation.
risk_explanation: >
  Container escape gives an attacker access to the host system and all
  other containers running on it. Mounting the Docker socket allows
  creating privileged containers with host access. Host filesystem
  mounts bypass container isolation entirely. Container escape from an
  MCP server compromises the entire host infrastructure.
remediation: >
  Never mount the Docker socket into MCP server containers. Restrict
  host filesystem mounts to specific required paths with read-only
  access. Use rootless containers and user namespace mapping. Drop all
  unnecessary Linux capabilities. Implement seccomp profiles to restrict
  system calls.
