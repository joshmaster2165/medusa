title: System Registry Access
category: privilege_scope
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP tools with access to system registry (Windows) or global
  configuration files (Linux /etc/). System-level configuration access
  allows modifying OS behaviour, security settings, and service
  configurations.
risk_explanation: >
  System registry or global configuration access allows an attacker to
  disable security features, modify startup programs, change network
  settings, or alter service configurations. On Windows, registry
  modifications can install persistence mechanisms, disable antivirus,
  or modify authentication settings. On Linux, modifying /etc/ files can
  alter PAM, sudoers, or SSH configurations.
remediation: >
  Restrict MCP tools from accessing system-level configuration. Use
  read-only access where system information must be read. Implement file
  integrity monitoring on critical system configuration. Run MCP servers
  in containers that do not mount system configuration directories.
