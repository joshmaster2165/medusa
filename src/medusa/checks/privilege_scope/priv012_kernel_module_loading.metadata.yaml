title: Kernel Module Loading
category: privilege_scope
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that can load kernel modules or interact with kernel
  interfaces. Kernel module loading provides the highest level of system
  access, operating in ring 0 with complete control over the operating
  system.
risk_explanation: >
  Kernel module loading allows installation of rootkits that operate
  below the operating system's security mechanisms. Kernel modules can
  hide processes, intercept system calls, modify network traffic, and
  access any memory location. A malicious kernel module is effectively
  undetectable by user-space security tools.
remediation: >
  Never grant MCP tools kernel module loading capabilities. Use Secure
  Boot with module signing to prevent unsigned module loading. Run MCP
  servers in unprivileged containers with dropped CAP_SYS_MODULE. Lock
  down the kernel module loading interface using sysctl settings.
