title: Database Admin Operations
category: privilege_scope
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP tools with DDL (Data Definition Language) or
  administrative database privileges. Tools that can CREATE, ALTER,
  DROP, GRANT, or TRUNCATE have capabilities far beyond data query and
  manipulation.
risk_explanation: >
  Database admin privileges allow an attacker to drop tables (data
  destruction), create new administrative users (persistence), modify
  schemas (data corruption), and grant themselves additional permissions
  (escalation). Admin operations bypass row-level security and can
  affect the entire database instance.
remediation: >
  Restrict MCP tools to the minimum required database privileges
  (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE on specific tables). Use separate database
  accounts for DDL and DML operations. Implement database audit logging
  for all DDL operations. Never grant GRANT or SUPERUSER privileges to
  MCP tool database accounts.
