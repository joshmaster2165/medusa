title: Sudo/Root Elevation
category: privilege_scope
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that execute commands with elevated privileges using
  sudo, su, runas, or equivalent mechanisms. Tools running as root or
  with elevated privileges can modify any system resource and bypass all
  OS-level access controls.
risk_explanation: >
  Tools executing with root or elevated privileges have unrestricted
  access to the entire system, including all files, processes, network
  interfaces, and kernel settings. An attacker exploiting a root-level
  tool can install rootkits, modify system configuration, access any
  user's data, and establish persistent backdoors that survive reboots.
remediation: >
  Never run MCP tools with elevated privileges. Use dedicated service
  accounts with the minimum required permissions. Implement capability-
  based security (Linux capabilities) instead of full root access. Run
  MCP servers in unprivileged containers with dropped capabilities.
  Audit all tools for sudo or elevation commands.
