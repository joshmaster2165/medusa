title: Package Installation Rights
category: privilege_scope
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that can install system packages (apt, yum, brew,
  pip install, npm install -g). Package installation allows adding
  arbitrary software to the system, including malicious packages from
  compromised registries.
risk_explanation: >
  Package installation enables supply chain attacks where malicious
  packages execute code during installation. System-level package
  installation modifies the OS installation, potentially overwriting
  existing binaries with trojanized versions. Global package
  installations persist across reboots and affect all users of the
  system.
remediation: >
  Restrict MCP tools from installing packages. Use pre-built container
  images with all required dependencies. Implement package allowlists
  for environments where installation is required. Use package signing
  verification and hash pinning for any packages that must be installed.
