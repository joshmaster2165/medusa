title: Missing Least Privilege
category: privilege_scope
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP servers requesting more permissions than their tools
  require. Servers that request broad filesystem, network, or system
  access when their tools only need narrow capabilities violate the
  principle of least privilege.
risk_explanation: >
  Over-privileged servers amplify the impact of any vulnerability. A
  tool that only needs to read a single configuration file but has full
  filesystem access allows exploitation to read any file on the system.
  Excess permissions are dormant attack surface that becomes exploitable
  through any vulnerability in the server's tools.
remediation: >
  Audit all server permissions against actual tool requirements. Remove
  permissions that are not actively used by any tool. Implement
  capability-based security where each tool declares its required
  permissions. Use the MCP tool annotations to document required
  capabilities and validate them against actual server permissions.
