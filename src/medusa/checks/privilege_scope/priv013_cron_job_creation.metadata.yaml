title: Cron/Scheduled Task Creation
category: privilege_scope
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that can create cron jobs, scheduled tasks, or
  systemd timers. Scheduled task creation is a common persistence
  mechanism that allows an attacker to maintain access and execute
  commands at regular intervals.
risk_explanation: >
  Cron jobs and scheduled tasks provide persistent code execution that
  survives reboots and user logouts. An attacker can install scheduled
  tasks that periodically exfiltrate data, maintain reverse shells, or
  re-establish compromised access. Scheduled tasks run without user
  interaction and are often overlooked during security reviews.
remediation: >
  Restrict MCP tools from creating scheduled tasks. Implement monitoring
  for changes to cron directories, crontab files, and systemd timer
  units. Run MCP servers in containers without access to scheduling
  services. Audit existing scheduled tasks regularly for unauthorized
  entries.
