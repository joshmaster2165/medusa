title: RBAC Bypass Risk
category: privilege_scope
severity: high
description: >
  Detects missing role-based access control on tool invocations. MCP
  servers that do not implement RBAC allow any authenticated user to
  invoke any tool, regardless of their role or the sensitivity of the
  operation.
risk_explanation: >
  Without RBAC, a low-privilege user can invoke administrative tools
  such as user management, configuration changes, and data export. The
  absence of role differentiation means that a single compromised
  credential grants access to all server capabilities. RBAC is essential
  for limiting the blast radius of credential compromise.
remediation: >
  Implement role-based access control that maps user roles to permitted
  tool sets. Define roles with the minimum required tool access (viewer,
  editor, admin). Validate the caller's role before executing each tool
  invocation. Use the MCP authorization framework to enforce per-tool
  access policies.
