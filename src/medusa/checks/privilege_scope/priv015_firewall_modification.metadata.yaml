title: Firewall Rule Modification
category: privilege_scope
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that can modify network firewall rules (iptables,
  nftables, Windows Firewall, cloud security groups). Firewall
  modification can expose internal services, disable network security
  controls, and enable lateral movement.
risk_explanation: >
  Firewall rule modification allows an attacker to open network ports,
  exposing internal services to the internet. Disabling firewall rules
  removes network-level security controls, enabling unrestricted lateral
  movement. In cloud environments, security group modifications can
  expose databases and internal APIs to the public internet.
remediation: >
  Never grant MCP tools firewall modification capabilities. Use
  infrastructure-as-code for firewall management with proper change
  control. Implement firewall rule monitoring and alerting for
  unauthorized changes. Run MCP servers in network segments that cannot
  reach firewall management interfaces.
