title: User Management Operations
category: privilege_scope
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that can create, modify, or delete system users and
  groups. User management capabilities allow an attacker to create
  backdoor accounts, modify group memberships, and escalate privileges.
risk_explanation: >
  User management tools allow creating administrative accounts that
  provide persistent backdoor access. Modifying group memberships can
  escalate privileges by adding users to sudo, docker, or admin groups.
  Deleting users can cause denial of service and data loss. User
  management is a critical administrative function that should never be
  exposed through MCP tools.
remediation: >
  Remove user management capabilities from MCP tools. Use dedicated
  identity management systems for user provisioning. Implement
  monitoring for unauthorized user and group changes. Run MCP servers
  with service accounts that lack user management permissions.
