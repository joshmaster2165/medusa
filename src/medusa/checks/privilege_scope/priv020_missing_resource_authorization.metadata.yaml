title: Missing Resource Authorization
category: privilege_scope
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP resources that can be accessed without authorization
  checks. Resources without access control allow any authenticated user
  to read, modify, or delete any resource regardless of ownership or
  permissions.
risk_explanation: >
  Missing resource authorization means that authentication alone is
  considered sufficient for access. Any authenticated user can access
  all resources, including other users' private data, administrative
  configurations, and sensitive documents. This violates the principle
  of least privilege and enables data breaches through compromised low-
  privilege accounts.
remediation: >
  Implement authorization checks on all resource access operations.
  Verify that the requesting user has the specific permission required
  for the operation (read, write, delete) on the specific resource. Use
  attribute-based access control (ABAC) or role-based access control
  (RBAC) to define and enforce resource access policies.
