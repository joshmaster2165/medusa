title: IDOR in Resource Access
category: privilege_scope
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP resources accessible via sequential or easily guessable
  identifiers without proper authorization. Insecure Direct Object
  References allow users to access resources belonging to other users by
  manipulating ID values.
risk_explanation: >
  IDOR vulnerabilities allow an attacker to enumerate and access all
  resources by iterating through sequential IDs. A user who accesses
  /resource/123 can access /resource/124 and all other resources without
  authorization checks. This exposes other users' data, including
  personal information, documents, and configuration.
remediation: >
  Implement authorization checks on every resource access, not just
  authentication. Use UUIDs or opaque identifiers instead of sequential
  IDs. Verify that the requesting user has permission to access the
  specific resource. Implement resource-level access control lists that
  enforce ownership and sharing rules.
