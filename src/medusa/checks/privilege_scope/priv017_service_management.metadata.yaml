title: System Service Management
category: privilege_scope
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that can start, stop, enable, or modify system
  services (systemd, init.d, Windows Services). Service management
  allows disrupting critical system functions and installing persistent
  backdoor services.
risk_explanation: >
  Service management capabilities allow an attacker to stop security
  services (antivirus, logging, monitoring), install new malicious
  services for persistence, and modify existing service configurations
  to execute attacker code. Stopping critical services causes denial of
  service, while installing new services provides persistent access.
remediation: >
  Remove system service management capabilities from MCP tools. Use
  dedicated orchestration tools for service management. Implement
  monitoring for unauthorized service changes. Run MCP servers in
  containers that cannot access the host's service management
  interfaces.
