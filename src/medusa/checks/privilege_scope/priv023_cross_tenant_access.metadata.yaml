title: Cross-Tenant Data Access
category: privilege_scope
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that can access data across tenant boundaries in
  multi-tenant environments. Cross-tenant access breaks the fundamental
  isolation guarantee of multi-tenant systems, exposing one tenant's
  data to another.
risk_explanation: >
  Cross-tenant data access is the most severe authorization failure in
  multi-tenant systems. An attacker in one tenant can read, modify, or
  delete another tenant's data, including confidential business data,
  personal information, and application configuration. Cross-tenant
  access often results in regulatory violations and breach notification
  requirements.
remediation: >
  Implement mandatory tenant isolation at the data access layer. Use
  tenant-scoped database connections or row-level security with tenant
  ID filtering. Validate tenant context on every data access operation.
  Implement database-level policies that enforce tenant isolation
  independent of application code. Conduct regular cross-tenant access
  testing.
