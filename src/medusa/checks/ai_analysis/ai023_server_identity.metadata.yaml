description: >
  AI-powered semantic analysis mirroring all server_identity static checks.
  Uses Claude to detect duplicate server names, unverified identities,
  and server impersonation risks.

  identity spoofing, implicit trust in server names, and context-dependent
  impersonation vectors.
remediation: >
  Review AI-flagged server identity issues and apply the specific
  remediation suggested for each finding.
