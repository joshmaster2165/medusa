title: "[AI] Rate Limiting Analysis"
category: ai_analysis
severity: medium
description: >
  AI-powered semantic analysis mirroring all rate_limiting static checks.
  Uses Claude to detect missing rate limits, denial of service risks,
  and resource exhaustion vulnerabilities.
risk_explanation: >
  Static checks match known rate limiting patterns; AI detects implicit
  DoS vectors, resource exhaustion paths, and missing throttling that
  regex cannot identify.
remediation: >
  Review AI-flagged rate limiting issues and apply the specific
  remediation suggested for each finding.
