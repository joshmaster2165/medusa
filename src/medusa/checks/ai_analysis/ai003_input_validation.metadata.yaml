title: "[AI] Input Validation Analysis"
category: ai_analysis
severity: critical
description: >
  AI-powered semantic analysis mirroring all input_validation static checks.
  Uses Claude to detect command injection, path traversal, SQL injection,
  missing schemas, and permissive validation that pattern matching misses.
risk_explanation: >
  Static checks use regex patterns for known injection vectors; AI can
  detect obfuscated injection, context-dependent validation gaps, and
  novel attack patterns in parameter schemas.
remediation: >
  Review AI-flagged input validation issues and apply the specific
  remediation suggested for each finding.
