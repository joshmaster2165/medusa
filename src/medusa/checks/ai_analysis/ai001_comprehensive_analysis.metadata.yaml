title: "[AI] Comprehensive Security Analysis"
category: ai_analysis
severity: high
description: >
  AI-powered deep analysis of MCP server security using Claude. Performs
  semantic analysis of tool descriptions, input schemas, resource definitions,
  prompt content, and server configuration to detect vulnerabilities that
  static pattern matching cannot catch.
risk_explanation: >
  Static checks can only detect known patterns like regex matches and keyword
  lists. Sophisticated attacks use paraphrasing, context manipulation, and
  subtle semantic tricks that require AI-level understanding to detect.
  This check catches social engineering in tool descriptions, implicit
  privilege escalation, dangerous tool combinations, and hidden intent.
remediation: >
  Review each AI finding and apply the specific remediation suggested.
  AI findings include detailed evidence and actionable recommendations
  for each detected issue.
