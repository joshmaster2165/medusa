title: "[AI] Tool Poisoning Analysis"
category: ai_analysis
severity: critical
description: >
  AI-powered semantic analysis mirroring all tool_poisoning static checks.
  Uses Claude to detect hidden instructions, prompt injection, tool shadowing,
  and other poisoning attacks that static pattern matching cannot catch.
risk_explanation: >
  Static checks use pattern matching; AI catches subtle poisoning that
  regex misses, including paraphrased instructions, context manipulation,
  and social engineering in tool descriptions.
remediation: >
  Review AI-flagged tools for hidden intent, social engineering, and
  shadowing. Apply the specific remediation suggested for each finding.
