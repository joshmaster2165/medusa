title: "[AI] Authentication Analysis"
category: ai_analysis
severity: high
description: >
  AI-powered semantic analysis mirroring all authentication static checks.
  Uses Claude to detect missing authentication, weak token handling,
  insecure OAuth flows, and credential management issues.
risk_explanation: >
  Static checks detect known authentication anti-patterns; AI catches
  subtle misconfigurations, implicit trust assumptions, and authentication
  bypass vectors that regex cannot identify.
remediation: >
  Review AI-flagged authentication issues and apply the specific
  remediation suggested for each finding.
