title: "[AI] Credential Exposure Analysis"
category: ai_analysis
severity: critical
description: >
  AI-powered semantic analysis mirroring all credential_exposure static checks.
  Uses Claude to detect secrets in config, environment variable leakage,
  and credential exposure in definitions that pattern matching misses.
risk_explanation: >
  Static checks match known secret patterns; AI detects obfuscated
  credentials, encoded secrets, and context-dependent exposure risks.
remediation: >
  Review AI-flagged credential exposure issues and apply the specific
  remediation suggested for each finding.
