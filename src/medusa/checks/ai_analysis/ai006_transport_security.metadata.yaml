title: "[AI] Transport Security Analysis"
category: ai_analysis
severity: high
description: >
  AI-powered semantic analysis mirroring all transport_security static checks.
  Uses Claude to detect unencrypted transport, missing cert validation,
  insecure TLS config, and missing transport authentication.
risk_explanation: >
  Static checks match known insecure transport patterns; AI detects
  subtle misconfigurations, implicit trust assumptions, and protocol
  weaknesses that regex cannot identify.
remediation: >
  Review AI-flagged transport security issues and apply the specific
  remediation suggested for each finding.
