title: "[AI] Sampling Security Analysis"
category: ai_analysis
severity: high
description: >
  AI-powered semantic analysis mirroring all sampling_security static checks.
  Uses Claude to detect sampling manipulation, unsafe sampling parameters,
  and model output control vulnerabilities.
risk_explanation: >
  Static checks match known sampling patterns; AI detects subtle
  sampling manipulation, implicit bias injection, and context-dependent
  output control issues.
remediation: >
  Review AI-flagged sampling security issues and apply the specific
  remediation suggested for each finding.
