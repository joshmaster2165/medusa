title: "[AI] Prompt Security Analysis"
category: ai_analysis
severity: critical
description: >
  AI-powered semantic analysis mirroring all prompt_security static checks.
  Uses Claude to detect prompt injection vectors, prompt leakage risks,
  and unsafe prompt argument handling.
risk_explanation: >
  Static checks match known prompt injection patterns; AI detects subtle
  prompt manipulation, context-dependent injection vectors, and novel
  prompt attack techniques that regex cannot identify.
remediation: >
  Review AI-flagged prompt security issues and apply the specific
  remediation suggested for each finding.
