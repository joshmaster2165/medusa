title: "[AI] SSRF & Network Analysis"
category: ai_analysis
severity: high
description: >
  AI-powered semantic analysis mirroring all ssrf_and_network static checks.
  Uses Claude to detect SSRF vectors, internal network access, and
  network-based attack paths.
risk_explanation: >
  Static checks match known SSRF patterns; AI detects obfuscated URLs,
  indirect network access, and context-dependent SSRF vectors that
  regex cannot identify.
remediation: >
  Review AI-flagged SSRF and network issues and apply the specific
  remediation suggested for each finding.
