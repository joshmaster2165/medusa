title: "[AI] Agentic Behavior Analysis"
category: ai_analysis
severity: high
description: >
  AI-powered semantic analysis mirroring all agentic_behavior static checks.
  Uses Claude to detect missing human-in-the-loop, autonomous action risks,
  agent loop detection, and multi-step attack chains.
risk_explanation: >
  Static checks match known agentic patterns; AI detects subtle
  autonomous behavior risks, implicit delegation, and emergent
  multi-step attack paths that regex cannot identify.
remediation: >
  Review AI-flagged agentic behavior issues and apply the specific
  remediation suggested for each finding.
