category: ai_analysis
severity: high
description: >
  AI-powered semantic analysis mirroring all supply_chain static checks.
  Uses Claude to detect untrusted package sources, dependency risks,
  and supply chain attack vectors.
risk_explanation: >
  Static checks match known supply chain patterns; AI detects subtle
  dependency risks, implicit trust in third-party code, and novel
  supply chain attack paths.
remediation: >
  Review AI-flagged supply chain issues and apply the specific
  remediation suggested for each finding.
