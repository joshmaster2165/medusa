title: "[AI] Privilege Scope Analysis"
category: ai_analysis
severity: critical
description: >
  AI-powered semantic analysis mirroring all privilege_scope static checks.
  Uses Claude to detect filesystem access, network access, shell execution,
  and other over-privileged tool capabilities.
risk_explanation: >
  Static checks match known privilege patterns; AI detects implicit
  privilege escalation, dangerous tool combinations, and subtle scope
  violations that regex cannot identify.
remediation: >
  Review AI-flagged privilege scope issues and apply the specific
  remediation suggested for each finding.
