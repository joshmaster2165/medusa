title: "[AI] Error Handling Analysis"
category: ai_analysis
severity: medium
description: >
  AI-powered semantic analysis mirroring all error_handling static checks.
  Uses Claude to detect information disclosure in errors, missing error
  handling, and insecure failure modes.
risk_explanation: >
  Static checks match known error patterns; AI detects contextual
  information leakage, implicit failure modes, and error handling
  gaps that regex cannot identify.
remediation: >
  Review AI-flagged error handling issues and apply the specific
  remediation suggested for each finding.
