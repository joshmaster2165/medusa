title: Plaintext Secrets in Configuration
category: secrets_management
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP server configuration files that contain secrets such as
  API keys, database passwords, encryption keys, and OAuth tokens stored
  in plaintext without encryption. Plaintext secrets in configuration
  files are the most common credential exposure vector.
risk_explanation: >
  Plaintext secrets in configuration files are exposed to anyone with
  read access to the file system, including other processes on the same
  host, backup systems, configuration management tools, and log
  aggregators that capture configuration data. A single file read
  vulnerability or misconfigured file permissions exposes all secrets in
  the configuration, often granting access to databases, external APIs,
  and other critical services.
remediation: >
  Move all secrets out of configuration files and into a dedicated
  secrets management service such as HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets
  Manager, or Azure Key Vault. Use encrypted configuration values with
  runtime decryption as an intermediate step. Implement configuration
  scanning in CI/CD pipelines that blocks deployments containing
  plaintext secrets. Rotate any secrets that were previously stored in
  plaintext.
