title: Missing Secret Rotation
category: secrets_management
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that use long-lived secrets without a rotation
  policy or mechanism. Secrets that are never rotated remain valid
  indefinitely, extending the window of opportunity for compromised
  credentials to be exploited.
risk_explanation: >
  Without secret rotation, a compromised credential remains valid until
  manually revoked, which may never happen if the compromise goes
  undetected. Long-lived secrets accumulate exposure through backup
  systems, log files, memory dumps, and personnel changes. The longer a
  secret exists, the more opportunities arise for it to be exposed
  through any of these channels.
remediation: >
  Implement automated secret rotation with configurable rotation periods
  based on secret sensitivity. Use short-lived tokens and certificates
  that expire automatically. Set up rotation schedules that align with
  compliance requirements. Implement zero-downtime rotation that
  supports overlapping validity periods during transitions. Monitor for
  secrets that exceed their rotation deadline.
