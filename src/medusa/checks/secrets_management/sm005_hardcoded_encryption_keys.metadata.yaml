title: Hardcoded Encryption Keys
category: secrets_management
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP server source code or configuration that contains
  hardcoded encryption keys, initialization vectors, or salt values.
  Hardcoded cryptographic material makes encryption effectively useless
  as the keys are available to anyone with code access.
risk_explanation: >
  Hardcoded encryption keys mean that every deployment uses the same
  cryptographic material. Anyone with access to the source code,
  compiled binary, or a decompiled version can decrypt all data
  encrypted by any instance of the server. This defeats the purpose of
  encryption entirely and exposes all encrypted data across all
  deployments simultaneously.
remediation: >
  Generate unique encryption keys per deployment using a
  cryptographically secure random number generator. Store encryption
  keys in a hardware security module or secrets management service. Use
  key derivation functions to generate per-purpose keys from master
  keys. Implement key management that supports rotation without re-
  encrypting all data. Remove all hardcoded keys from source code and
  configuration.
