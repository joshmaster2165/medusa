title: Missing Secret Access Audit
category: secrets_management
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that do not log or audit access to secrets.
  Without secret access auditing, it is impossible to determine who
  accessed which secrets, when access occurred, or whether access was
  authorized after a security incident.
risk_explanation: >
  Missing secret access auditing prevents detection of unauthorized
  secret access and makes incident investigation impossible. If a secret
  is compromised, the lack of audit logs means the breach timeline,
  scope, and impact cannot be determined. This also fails compliance
  requirements that mandate auditable access to cryptographic material
  and credentials.
remediation: >
  Implement comprehensive audit logging for all secret access operations
  including reads, writes, rotations, and deletions. Log the accessor
  identity, timestamp, secret identifier, operation type, and access
  context. Store audit logs in tamper-proof storage separate from the
  secrets themselves. Set up alerts for anomalous secret access patterns
  such as bulk reads or access from unexpected sources.
