title: Missing Secret Revocation
category: secrets_management
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that lack the ability to immediately revoke
  secrets when they are compromised. Without revocation capability,
  compromised secrets remain valid until they expire naturally, which
  may be never for long-lived credentials.
risk_explanation: >
  When a secret compromise is detected, the ability to immediately
  revoke the secret is critical to limiting damage. Without revocation,
  the compromised secret continues to grant access while the incident is
  being investigated and resolved. For secrets without expiration, the
  compromised credential may be used indefinitely. Each minute of
  continued validity after detection extends the window for data
  exfiltration and lateral movement.
remediation: >
  Implement immediate secret revocation for all credential types.
  Maintain a revocation list that is checked on every authentication
  attempt. Use short-lived tokens that require frequent renewal,
  limiting the impact window of compromise. Integrate revocation with
  incident response workflows for automated response. Test revocation
  procedures regularly to ensure they work under pressure.
