title: Default Secrets in Use
category: secrets_management
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that are using default secrets, example tokens, or
  placeholder credentials that were included in documentation, sample
  configurations, or initial setup scripts. Default secrets are publicly
  known and provide trivial unauthorized access.
risk_explanation: >
  Default secrets are documented in installation guides, source code
  repositories, and tutorial materials that are publicly accessible.
  Automated scanning tools continuously probe for servers using known
  default credentials. An MCP server using default secrets can be
  compromised within seconds of being exposed to the internet, as no
  vulnerability discovery is required. This is one of the most common
  and easily prevented causes of server compromise.
remediation: >
  Replace all default secrets during initial server setup before
  accepting any client connections. Implement first-run checks that
  detect default secrets and refuse to start. Generate unique random
  secrets during installation. Scan running deployments for known
  default values. Remove example credentials from documentation and
  replace them with generation instructions.
