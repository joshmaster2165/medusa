title: Missing Secret Access Control
category: secrets_management
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP servers where secrets are accessible to all server
  components, tools, and processes without granular access controls.
  Missing access control on secrets means that any tool or code running
  within the server can access all secrets regardless of whether it
  needs them.
risk_explanation: >
  Without secret access controls, a vulnerability in any single tool or
  component exposes all server secrets. The principle of least privilege
  requires that each component only has access to the secrets it needs.
  When all secrets are accessible to all components, a compromised tool
  handler that only needs one API key can access database credentials,
  encryption keys, and all other secrets, maximizing the blast radius of
  any compromise.
remediation: >
  Implement granular access controls on the secret store that restrict
  each tool and component to only the secrets it requires. Use separate
  service accounts or access policies per tool. Audit secret access
  patterns to identify and remove unnecessary access grants. Implement
  secret access request workflows for new components. Monitor for
  anomalous secret access patterns that may indicate compromise.
