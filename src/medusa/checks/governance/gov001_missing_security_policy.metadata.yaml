title: Missing Security Policy
category: governance
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that lack a documented security policy
  defining security requirements, controls, and responsibilities for the
  MCP server and its integrations. A security policy establishes the
  baseline for secure operation and communicates expectations to all
  stakeholders.
risk_explanation: >
  Without a documented security policy, MCP server deployments operate
  without defined security requirements or accountability. Developers
  and operators make ad-hoc security decisions without consistent
  guidance, leading to gaps in protection. Incident response is hampered
  because there is no reference for expected security posture.
  Compliance audits cannot assess conformance to requirements that do
  not exist.
remediation: >
  Create and maintain a comprehensive security policy for the MCP server
  deployment. The policy should define security requirements for
  authentication, authorization, data protection, transport security,
  logging, and incident response. Specify roles and responsibilities for
  security management. Review and update the policy annually or when
  significant changes occur. Ensure all operators and developers
  acknowledge the policy.
