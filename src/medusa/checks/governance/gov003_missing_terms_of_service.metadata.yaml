title: Missing Terms of Service
category: governance
severity: low
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that lack terms of service defining
  acceptable use, limitations of liability, and user responsibilities.
  Terms of service establish the contractual framework for MCP server
  usage and set expectations for both operators and users.
risk_explanation: >
  Without terms of service, MCP server operators have no legal framework
  for managing user behavior, limiting liability, or enforcing
  acceptable use policies. Users may misuse the server for purposes it
  was not designed for, abuse tool access in ways that affect other
  users, or hold the operator liable for damages caused by tool
  invocations. The absence of terms creates legal uncertainty for all
  parties.
remediation: >
  Develop terms of service that define acceptable use policies for the
  MCP server, including permitted and prohibited actions, liability
  limitations, and service level expectations. Address the unique
  aspects of MCP server usage including tool invocation
  responsibilities, data processing consent, and autonomous agent
  behavior. Have the terms reviewed by legal counsel and require user
  acceptance before granting access.
