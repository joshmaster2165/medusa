title: Missing SLA Definition
category: governance
severity: low
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that lack defined service level
  agreements (SLAs) specifying availability targets, performance
  requirements, and support response times. SLAs set expectations for
  service quality and provide a framework for measuring and reporting on
  operational performance.
risk_explanation: >
  Without SLAs, there are no measurable commitments for MCP server
  availability, performance, or support. Users and dependent systems
  have no basis for planning around MCP server reliability. Performance
  degradation goes unmeasured and unreported because there are no
  defined thresholds. This creates a disconnect between user
  expectations and actual service delivery that manifests as user
  dissatisfaction and unplanned workflow disruptions.
remediation: >
  Define SLAs for the MCP server deployment including availability
  targets (such as 99.9% uptime), response time requirements (such as
  less than 200ms p95), and support response times for different
  severity levels. Implement monitoring that measures SLA compliance
  continuously. Publish SLA dashboards for transparency. Define
  remediation procedures for SLA violations. Review SLAs annually and
  adjust based on operational history.
