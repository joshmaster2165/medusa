title: Missing Asset Inventory
category: governance
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that lack a comprehensive inventory of
  all MCP servers, tools, resources, integrations, and dependencies.
  Without an asset inventory, organizations cannot assess their attack
  surface or ensure all components receive appropriate security
  controls.
risk_explanation: >
  Without an asset inventory, organizations have an incomplete picture
  of their MCP deployment surface. Unknown MCP servers, untracked tool
  integrations, and undocumented dependencies create blind spots in
  security monitoring and vulnerability management. Shadow MCP servers
  deployed by individual teams may lack security controls entirely.
  Forgotten tools may retain access to sensitive resources. The asset
  inventory gap grows over time as new components are added without
  tracking.
remediation: >
  Create and maintain a comprehensive inventory of all MCP servers,
  tools, resources, external integrations, and dependencies. Include
  metadata such as owner, purpose, data classification, and security
  controls for each asset. Implement automated discovery that detects
  new MCP servers and tools as they are deployed. Review the inventory
  quarterly for accuracy. Use the inventory as the basis for security
  assessments, vulnerability management, and access reviews.
