title: Missing Business Continuity Plan
category: governance
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that lack a business continuity plan
  for maintaining MCP server operations during disruptions including
  infrastructure failures, security incidents, and service provider
  outages.
risk_explanation: >
  MCP servers may become critical infrastructure for organizations that
  depend on them for automated workflows, data processing, and business
  operations. Without a business continuity plan, disruptions to the MCP
  server cause unplanned downtime, data loss, and business process
  failures. The interconnected nature of MCP tool invocations means a
  single service disruption can cascade across multiple dependent
  workflows.
remediation: >
  Develop a business continuity plan that addresses MCP server
  availability requirements including maximum tolerable downtime,
  recovery point objectives, and failover procedures. Identify critical
  tool dependencies and plan for their unavailability. Implement
  redundancy for critical MCP server components. Define communication
  procedures for service disruptions. Test the continuity plan regularly
  through tabletop exercises and failover drills.
