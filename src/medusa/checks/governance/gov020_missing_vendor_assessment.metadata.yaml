title: Missing Vendor Security Assessment
category: governance
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that use third-party MCP servers,
  tools, or LLM providers without conducting vendor security
  assessments. Third-party vendors that process data through MCP
  integrations must meet security requirements commensurate with the
  sensitivity of the data they handle.
risk_explanation: >
  Third-party MCP server vendors and tool providers have direct access
  to data flowing through tool invocations and may store, process, or
  transmit this data in ways the organization cannot control. Without
  vendor security assessments, organizations trust vendors with
  sensitive data based on marketing claims rather than verified security
  practices. A vendor security breach can expose all data processed
  through their MCP servers or tools, and the organization bears the
  regulatory and reputational consequences.
remediation: >
  Conduct security assessments for all third-party MCP server vendors,
  tool providers, and LLM service providers. Request SOC 2 Type II
  reports, penetration test summaries, and security certifications.
  Evaluate vendors against your organization's security requirements.
  Include security requirements in vendor contracts and service
  agreements. Conduct annual vendor security reviews and require breach
  notification commitments. Maintain a vendor risk register that tracks
  assessment status and findings.
