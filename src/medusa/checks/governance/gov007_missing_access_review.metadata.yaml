title: Missing Access Review Process
category: governance
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that lack periodic access reviews to
  verify that user permissions, tool access grants, and API keys remain
  appropriate. Without access reviews, permissions accumulate over time
  and former users may retain access they no longer need.
risk_explanation: >
  Without periodic access reviews, MCP server permissions drift from
  their intended state. Users accumulate tool access they no longer
  need, former employees retain active credentials, and API keys created
  for temporary purposes remain valid indefinitely. This expanded access
  surface increases the risk of unauthorized tool invocations, data
  access, and privilege escalation. Stale credentials are prime targets
  for attackers.
remediation: >
  Implement a periodic access review process that audits all user
  permissions, tool access grants, API keys, and service accounts
  associated with the MCP server. Conduct reviews quarterly at minimum.
  Revoke access for users who no longer require it. Rotate long-lived
  credentials. Implement automated access certification workflows that
  require managers to confirm each user's continued need for access.
