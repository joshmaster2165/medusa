title: Missing Compliance Mapping
category: governance
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that lack a mapping between security
  controls and applicable compliance frameworks such as SOC 2, ISO
  27001, NIST CSF, or industry-specific regulations. Compliance mapping
  demonstrates that security controls address regulatory requirements.
risk_explanation: >
  Without compliance mapping, organizations cannot demonstrate that
  their MCP server deployment meets regulatory requirements. This
  creates audit failures, regulatory fines, and potential legal
  liability. MCP servers that process sensitive data may be subject to
  multiple compliance frameworks, and without a mapping, gaps between
  implemented controls and required controls remain undetected until an
  audit or security incident reveals them.
remediation: >
  Create a compliance mapping document that maps each security control
  implemented in the MCP server deployment to the applicable compliance
  framework requirements. Identify gaps where compliance requirements
  are not met by current controls. Prioritize remediation of compliance
  gaps based on regulatory risk. Maintain the mapping as controls and
  regulations evolve. Use automated compliance monitoring tools where
  available.
