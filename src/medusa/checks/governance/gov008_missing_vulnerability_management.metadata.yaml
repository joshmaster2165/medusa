title: Missing Vulnerability Management
category: governance
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that lack a vulnerability management
  program covering dependency scanning, security patching, and
  vulnerability assessment. MCP servers depend on numerous libraries and
  frameworks that may contain known vulnerabilities.
risk_explanation: >
  MCP servers depend on LLM client libraries, web frameworks, database
  drivers, and numerous other dependencies that regularly receive
  security patches. Without vulnerability management, known
  vulnerabilities in these components remain unpatched, providing
  attackers with documented exploitation techniques. The MCP protocol
  specification itself evolves, and without tracking security
  advisories, servers may miss critical protocol-level security fixes.
remediation: >
  Implement a vulnerability management program that includes automated
  dependency scanning, regular security assessments, and a defined
  patching cadence. Use tools like Dependabot, Snyk, or OWASP
  Dependency-Check to identify known vulnerabilities in MCP server
  dependencies. Prioritize patching based on severity and
  exploitability. Track MCP protocol security advisories and apply
  relevant fixes. Conduct periodic penetration testing focused on MCP-
  specific attack vectors.
