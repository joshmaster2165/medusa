title: Missing Privacy Policy
category: governance
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that lack a privacy policy defining how
  user data, conversation content, tool inputs, and tool outputs are
  collected, processed, stored, and retained. MCP servers often process
  sensitive personal information through LLM interactions and tool
  invocations.
risk_explanation: >
  MCP servers process potentially sensitive data through tool
  invocations and LLM interactions, including personal information,
  business data, and conversation contents. Without a privacy policy,
  there is no defined framework for data handling, retention, or user
  rights. This creates legal and regulatory risk, particularly under
  GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations that require transparent
  data processing practices.
remediation: >
  Develop a privacy policy that covers all data processed by the MCP
  server including user inputs, tool parameters, tool outputs,
  conversation history, and session metadata. Define data retention
  periods, data subject rights, and data processing lawful bases.
  Specify how data is shared with LLM providers and external services
  accessed by tools. Make the privacy policy accessible to all users and
  review it regularly for regulatory compliance.
