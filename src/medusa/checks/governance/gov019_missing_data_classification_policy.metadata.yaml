title: Missing Data Classification Policy
category: governance
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that lack a data classification policy
  defining sensitivity levels and handling requirements for data
  processed through tool invocations. Without classification, all data
  receives the same handling regardless of sensitivity, leading to
  either over-protection of low-sensitivity data or under-protection of
  high-sensitivity data.
risk_explanation: >
  MCP servers process data of varying sensitivity through tool
  invocations, from public web content to highly confidential
  credentials and personal information. Without data classification,
  security controls cannot be applied proportionally. Low-sensitivity
  data may be over-protected, wasting resources, while high-sensitivity
  data may be under-protected, creating breach risk. LLM agents cannot
  make informed decisions about data handling without classification
  metadata, increasing the risk of inadvertent exposure.
remediation: >
  Define a data classification policy with at least three levels (such
  as public, internal, and confidential) and specify handling
  requirements for each level. Classify tool inputs and outputs by
  sensitivity. Implement technical controls that enforce classification-
  based handling such as encryption requirements, access restrictions,
  and retention limits. Tag data with classification metadata throughout
  the MCP processing pipeline. Train developers and operators on the
  classification policy.
