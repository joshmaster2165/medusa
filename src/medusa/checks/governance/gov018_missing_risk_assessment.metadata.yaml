title: Missing Risk Assessment
category: governance
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that have not undergone a formal risk
  assessment identifying threats, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts
  specific to MCP security. Risk assessment is the foundation of a risk-
  based security program that prioritizes controls based on actual
  threats.
risk_explanation: >
  Without a risk assessment, security investments are not aligned with
  actual threats. Organizations may over-invest in low-risk areas while
  leaving high-risk threats unaddressed. MCP servers face unique risks
  that differ from traditional web applications, including tool
  poisoning, prompt injection, agentic attacks, and sampling abuse. A
  risk assessment that does not account for these MCP-specific threats
  produces an incomplete picture that leaves critical vulnerabilities
  unaddressed.
remediation: >
  Conduct a formal risk assessment for the MCP server deployment that
  identifies MCP-specific threats, evaluates existing vulnerabilities,
  assesses potential business impacts, and prioritizes risks. Use a
  recognized risk assessment framework such as NIST SP 800-30 or ISO
  27005. Include MCP-specific attack scenarios from the OWASP MCP Top
  10. Produce a risk register and risk treatment plan. Review and update
  the risk assessment annually or when significant changes occur.
