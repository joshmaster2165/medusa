title: Missing Audit Schedule
category: governance
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that lack a defined schedule for
  security audits and assessments. Without regular audits, security
  controls degrade over time, new vulnerabilities go undetected, and
  compliance drift occurs without correction.
risk_explanation: >
  Security controls are not static; they degrade over time due to
  configuration drift, software updates, changing threat landscapes, and
  operational pressures. Without scheduled audits, these degradations
  accumulate undetected until a security incident reveals them. MCP
  servers are particularly susceptible because the rapidly evolving MCP
  ecosystem introduces new attack vectors that may not be covered by
  initial security controls.
remediation: >
  Establish a security audit schedule that includes annual comprehensive
  security assessments, quarterly vulnerability assessments, and monthly
  configuration reviews. Define audit scope to cover MCP-specific
  security controls including tool authentication, input validation,
  prompt injection defenses, and session management. Use both internal
  and external auditors. Track audit findings through remediation to
  closure. Report audit results to management stakeholders.
