title: Missing Third-Party Risk Assessment
category: governance
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that integrate with external MCP
  servers, APIs, or services without performing third-party risk
  assessments. External integrations introduce supply chain risks
  including data exposure to third parties and dependency on their
  security posture.
risk_explanation: >
  MCP servers often connect to external services through tool
  invocations, including cloud APIs, SaaS platforms, and third-party MCP
  servers. Each external integration introduces risk from the third
  party's security posture, data handling practices, and operational
  reliability. Without risk assessment, organizations accept unknown
  risks from every external integration, potentially exposing sensitive
  data to parties that do not meet their security requirements.
remediation: >
  Conduct third-party risk assessments for all external services
  integrated with the MCP server. Evaluate each third party's security
  certifications, data handling practices, incident response
  capabilities, and business continuity plans. Require security
  questionnaires or SOC 2 reports from critical third parties. Implement
  data minimization for third-party interactions. Review third-party
  risk assessments annually and when significant changes occur.
