title: Missing Incident Response Plan
category: governance
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that lack a documented incident
  response plan for security events. Without an incident response plan,
  organizations cannot effectively detect, contain, eradicate, and
  recover from security incidents affecting MCP server operations.
risk_explanation: >
  MCP servers face unique security risks including prompt injection,
  tool poisoning, session hijacking, and data exfiltration through tool
  abuse. Without an incident response plan tailored to these risks,
  organizations respond to incidents ad-hoc, leading to delayed
  containment, incomplete eradication, lost evidence, and prolonged
  recovery times. The autonomous nature of LLM agents means incidents
  can escalate rapidly, making preparedness critical.
remediation: >
  Develop an incident response plan that addresses MCP-specific security
  incidents including tool poisoning, prompt injection, session
  compromise, data exfiltration, and agent manipulation. Define incident
  severity levels, escalation procedures, communication plans, and
  recovery procedures. Include specific playbooks for common MCP attack
  scenarios. Conduct regular incident response exercises and update the
  plan based on lessons learned.
