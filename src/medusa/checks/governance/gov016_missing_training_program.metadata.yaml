title: Missing Security Training Program
category: governance
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments where developers and operators have not
  received security training covering MCP-specific threats including
  tool poisoning, prompt injection, SSRF through tools, and session
  management vulnerabilities.
risk_explanation: >
  Developers and operators who are unaware of MCP-specific security
  risks inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities during development and
  operations. MCP security threats such as tool poisoning, indirect
  prompt injection, and sampling attacks are novel and not covered by
  traditional security training. Without MCP-specific training, teams
  cannot design secure tools, configure servers defensively, or detect
  MCP-specific attacks during operations.
remediation: >
  Develop and deliver security training covering MCP-specific threats
  and defenses. Include topics such as tool poisoning prevention, prompt
  injection defense, SSRF mitigation in tools, secure session
  management, and sampling security. Train developers on secure tool
  development practices and operators on secure server configuration.
  Update training content as the MCP threat landscape evolves. Track
  training completion and require annual refresher training.
