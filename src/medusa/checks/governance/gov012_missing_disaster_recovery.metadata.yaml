title: Missing Disaster Recovery Plan
category: governance
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that lack a disaster recovery plan for
  restoring service after catastrophic events including data center
  failures, ransomware attacks, and data corruption. Disaster recovery
  ensures the ability to restore MCP server operations from a known good
  state.
risk_explanation: >
  Without disaster recovery planning, catastrophic events affecting the
  MCP server infrastructure can result in permanent data loss, extended
  outages, and inability to restore service. MCP servers may store
  critical configuration, tool definitions, user data, and audit logs
  that must be recoverable. Ransomware attacks targeting MCP
  infrastructure can encrypt all server data and configurations,
  requiring restoration from backups that may not exist without a
  disaster recovery plan.
remediation: >
  Develop a disaster recovery plan that includes backup and restoration
  procedures for all MCP server components including configurations,
  tool definitions, user data, and audit logs. Define recovery time
  objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO). Implement
  automated backups with off-site storage. Test disaster recovery
  procedures regularly through restoration drills. Maintain runbooks for
  common disaster scenarios.
