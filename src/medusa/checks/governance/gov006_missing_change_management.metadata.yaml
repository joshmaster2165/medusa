title: Missing Change Management Process
category: governance
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that lack a formal change management
  process for tool modifications, server configuration changes, and
  security policy updates. Uncontrolled changes can introduce security
  vulnerabilities, break existing security controls, or disrupt service
  availability.
risk_explanation: >
  Without change management, modifications to MCP server tools,
  configurations, and policies are made without review, testing, or
  approval. This allows security vulnerabilities to be introduced
  through code changes, misconfig- urations to weaken security controls,
  and untested changes to cause service disruptions. In MCP
  environments, a single tool change can affect all connected LLM
  clients and create new attack vectors for prompt injection or data
  exfiltration.
remediation: >
  Implement a change management process that requires review and
  approval for all changes to MCP server tools, configurations, and
  security policies. Include security review in the change approval
  process. Test changes in a staging environment before production
  deployment. Maintain a change log with rollback procedures. Implement
  automated testing that validates security controls after changes are
  applied.
