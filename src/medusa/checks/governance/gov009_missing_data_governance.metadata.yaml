title: Missing Data Governance Framework
category: governance
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that lack a data governance framework
  defining data ownership, classification, handling requirements, and
  lifecycle management for data processed through tool invocations and
  LLM interactions.
risk_explanation: >
  Without data governance, organizations cannot ensure that data
  processed by MCP servers is handled appropriately. Different types of
  data (PII, financial data, health records, proprietary information)
  require different handling controls, but without classification and
  governance, all data receives the same minimal treatment. This leads
  to regulatory violations, data breaches, and loss of customer trust
  when sensitive data is inadequately protected.
remediation: >
  Establish a data governance framework that defines data classification
  levels, ownership, handling requirements, and retention policies for
  all data processed by the MCP server. Classify tools by the
  sensitivity of data they process and apply appropriate controls.
  Implement data lineage tracking that records how data flows through
  tool invocations. Define data retention and deletion policies. Appoint
  data stewards responsible for governance compliance.
