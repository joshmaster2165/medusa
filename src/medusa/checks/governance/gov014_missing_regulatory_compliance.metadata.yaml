title: Missing Regulatory Compliance
category: governance
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that have not assessed or addressed
  applicable regulatory requirements. MCP servers processing personal
  data, financial information, or health records may be subject to GDPR,
  CCPA, PCI DSS, HIPAA, or other regulations that impose specific
  security and data handling requirements.
risk_explanation: >
  Non-compliance with applicable regulations exposes organizations to
  significant financial penalties, legal action, and reputational
  damage. GDPR violations can result in fines up to 4% of global annual
  revenue. HIPAA violations can result in fines up to $1.5 million per
  violation category. MCP servers that process regulated data through
  tool invocations are subject to the same regulatory requirements as
  any other data processing system, and the autonomous nature of LLM
  agents increases the risk of inadvertent violations.
remediation: >
  Conduct a regulatory assessment to identify all compliance
  requirements applicable to the MCP server deployment based on the
  types of data processed, the jurisdictions involved, and the industry.
  Map current security controls to regulatory requirements and identify
  gaps. Implement remediation plans for compliance gaps with defined
  timelines. Engage legal and compliance teams to validate regulatory
  interpretations. Maintain compliance documentation and undergo regular
  compliance audits.
