title: Twilio Credential Exposure
category: credential_exposure
severity: high
description: >
  Detects Twilio account SID and auth tokens in MCP server
  configuration. Twilio credentials grant access to send SMS messages,
  make phone calls, and access communication logs through the Twilio
  API.
risk_explanation: >
  Exposed Twilio credentials allow an attacker to send SMS and make
  phone calls at the account holder's expense. This can be used for SMS
  phishing (smishing), spam campaigns, and social engineering. Access to
  communication logs reveals phone numbers, message content, and call
  recordings. Financial impact from fraudulent API usage can be
  substantial.
remediation: >
  Store Twilio credentials in secrets managers. Use API key
  authentication instead of account SID and auth token. Implement usage
  alerts and spending limits. Restrict Twilio API keys to specific
  capabilities. Rotate credentials after any potential exposure.
