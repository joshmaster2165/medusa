title: SendGrid API Key Exposure
category: credential_exposure
severity: high
description: >
  Detects SendGrid API keys in MCP server configuration or environment.
  SendGrid API keys grant permissions to send emails, manage contacts,
  and access email analytics through the SendGrid platform.
risk_explanation: >
  Exposed SendGrid API keys allow an attacker to send emails through the
  organization's SendGrid account, bypassing email authentication (SPF,
  DKIM). The attacker can send phishing emails that appear to originate
  from the organization's verified domains. Access to contact lists
  exposes customer email addresses and metadata.
remediation: >
  Store SendGrid API keys in secrets managers. Use scoped API keys with
  minimal permissions (e.g. mail send only). Implement IP access
  management to restrict API key usage to known IP ranges. Monitor
  sending patterns for anomalies. Rotate API keys regularly.
