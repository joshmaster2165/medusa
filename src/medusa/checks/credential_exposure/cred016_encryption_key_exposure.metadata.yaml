title: Encryption Key Exposure
category: credential_exposure
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects symmetric or asymmetric encryption keys in MCP server
  configuration. Exposed encryption keys compromise the confidentiality
  of all data encrypted with those keys, including stored data and
  communications.
risk_explanation: >
  An exposed encryption key allows an attacker to decrypt all data
  protected by that key. For symmetric keys (AES, ChaCha20), this
  includes both encrypting new data and decrypting existing data. For
  asymmetric private keys, the attacker can decrypt communications and
  forge signatures. Historical encrypted data becomes retroactively
  compromised.
remediation: >
  Store encryption keys in hardware security modules (HSMs) or key
  management services (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, GCP Cloud KMS). Never
  embed encryption keys in configuration files. Implement key rotation
  with re-encryption of stored data. Use envelope encryption where the
  data encryption key is itself encrypted by a master key.
