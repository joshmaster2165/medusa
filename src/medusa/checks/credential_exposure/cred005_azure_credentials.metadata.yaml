title: Azure Credential Exposure
category: credential_exposure
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects Azure client secrets, certificate thumbprints, or managed
  identity credentials in MCP server configuration. Azure credentials in
  configuration files grant access to Azure Active Directory, storage
  accounts, databases, and other cloud services.
risk_explanation: >
  Exposed Azure credentials grant access to all resources the associated
  service principal or managed identity can access. This typically
  includes Azure AD operations, storage accounts, Key Vault secrets, and
  database connections. Client secrets in configuration are equivalent
  to a master key for the Azure tenant.
remediation: >
  Use Azure Managed Identity for authentication instead of client
  secrets. Store necessary credentials in Azure Key Vault and reference
  them via environment variables. Implement credential rotation
  policies. Remove any Azure credentials from configuration files and
  version control history.
