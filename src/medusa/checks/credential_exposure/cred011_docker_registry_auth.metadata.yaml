title: Docker Registry Auth Exposure
category: credential_exposure
severity: high
description: >
  Detects Docker registry authentication credentials in MCP server
  configuration. Docker registry auth tokens stored in config.json or
  environment variables grant access to pull and push container images.
risk_explanation: >
  Exposed Docker registry credentials allow an attacker to pull private
  container images containing proprietary code, push malicious images
  that will be deployed in production, or tamper with existing images.
  Registry access often includes images containing additional embedded
  secrets and configuration data.
remediation: >
  Use credential helpers for Docker registry authentication instead of
  storing credentials in config.json. Implement short-lived token-based
  authentication for CI/CD pipelines. Use cloud-native registry
  authentication (ECR, GCR, ACR) with IAM roles. Remove registry
  credentials from configuration files.
