title: Webhook Secret Exposure
category: credential_exposure
severity: high
description: >
  Detects webhook signing secrets in MCP server configuration. Webhook
  secrets are used to verify that incoming webhook requests originate
  from the expected source. Exposed secrets allow attackers to forge
  webhook payloads.
risk_explanation: >
  Webhook signing secrets validate the authenticity of incoming
  requests. An attacker who knows the secret can forge webhook payloads
  that pass signature verification, triggering arbitrary actions on the
  receiving server. This can include deployment triggers, notification
  systems, and automated workflows that trust webhook-delivered data.
remediation: >
  Store webhook secrets in secrets managers and reference them via
  environment variables. Rotate webhook secrets regularly. Implement
  additional validation beyond HMAC signature (IP allowlisting,
  timestamp checks). Monitor for unexpected webhook patterns that might
  indicate secret compromise.
