title: GCP Service Account Key Exposure
category: credential_exposure
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects Google Cloud Platform service account JSON key files in MCP
  server configuration or environment. GCP service account keys contain
  private keys that grant full access to the associated cloud project
  resources and APIs.
risk_explanation: >
  GCP service account JSON keys provide persistent, non-expiring access
  to cloud resources. A leaked key grants the attacker the full
  permissions of the service account, which often includes access to
  Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Compute Engine, and other services. Unlike
  short-lived tokens, service account keys remain valid until explicitly
  revoked.
remediation: >
  Use Workload Identity Federation or attached service accounts instead
  of JSON key files. If keys are required, store them in a secrets
  manager and reference them via environment variables. Rotate keys
  regularly and set up key expiration. Monitor for key usage anomalies.
  Delete unused service account keys.
