title: Redis Auth Exposure
category: credential_exposure
severity: high
description: >
  Detects Redis AUTH passwords in connection strings or MCP server
  configuration. Redis credentials in configuration files grant access
  to cached data, session stores, and potentially the entire key-value
  store.
risk_explanation: >
  Exposed Redis credentials grant access to all data stored in the Redis
  instance, which frequently includes session tokens, cached
  credentials, rate limiting state, and application data. Redis commands
  like CONFIG and DEBUG can be used for further exploitation, including
  writing files to the server filesystem.
remediation: >
  Store Redis passwords in secrets managers. Use ACL-based
  authentication with minimal permissions. Enable TLS for Redis
  connections. Restrict dangerous Redis commands (CONFIG, DEBUG, EVAL)
  using ACL rules. Implement network-level access controls to limit
  Redis connectivity.
