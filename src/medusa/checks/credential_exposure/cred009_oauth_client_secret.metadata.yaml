title: OAuth Client Secret Exposure
category: credential_exposure
severity: high
description: >
  Detects OAuth client secrets in MCP server configuration files. OAuth
  client secrets authenticate the application to the authorization
  server and should never be exposed in client-side or plaintext
  configuration.
risk_explanation: >
  An exposed OAuth client secret allows an attacker to impersonate the
  legitimate application to the authorization server. The attacker can
  exchange authorization codes for access tokens, request new tokens,
  and perform all API operations as the legitimate application. This
  compromises all users who have authorized the application.
remediation: >
  Store OAuth client secrets in secrets managers. Use environment
  variable references in configuration files. For public clients (SPAs,
  mobile apps), use PKCE without client secrets. Rotate client secrets
  regularly and monitor for unauthorized token issuance. Never include
  client secrets in client-side code or public repositories.
