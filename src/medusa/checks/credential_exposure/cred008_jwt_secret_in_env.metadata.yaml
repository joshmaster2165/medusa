title: JWT Secret in Environment
category: credential_exposure
severity: high
description: >
  Detects JWT signing secrets stored in environment variables or
  configuration files. The JWT secret is the root of trust for token
  verification; its exposure allows an attacker to forge arbitrary valid
  tokens.
risk_explanation: >
  The JWT signing secret enables creation of tokens with any claims,
  including admin roles and any user identity. An attacker who obtains
  the secret can bypass all authentication and authorization by forging
  tokens. The compromise is silent because forged tokens are
  indistinguishable from legitimate ones.
remediation: >
  Store JWT secrets in dedicated secrets managers (HashiCorp Vault, AWS
  Secrets Manager). Use asymmetric signing algorithms (RS256, ES256)
  where only the public key needs to be distributed. Rotate signing
  secrets regularly with overlap periods for token migration. Never
  commit JWT secrets to version control.
