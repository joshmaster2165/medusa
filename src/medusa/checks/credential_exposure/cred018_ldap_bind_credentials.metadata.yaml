title: LDAP Bind Credential Exposure
category: credential_exposure
severity: high
description: >
  Detects LDAP bind DN (Distinguished Name) and password in MCP server
  configuration. LDAP bind credentials authenticate the application to
  the directory server, often with broad read access to the entire
  directory tree.
risk_explanation: >
  Exposed LDAP bind credentials grant directory read access, enabling
  enumeration of all users, groups, organizational units, and their
  attributes. In Active Directory environments, this includes password
  hashes, email addresses, phone numbers, and group memberships. Write
  access allows modifying directory entries and group memberships.
remediation: >
  Store LDAP bind credentials in a secrets manager. Use service accounts
  with minimal required permissions (read-only, limited base DN).
  Implement LDAP connection pooling to minimize credential exposure. Use
  SASL/ Kerberos authentication instead of simple bind where possible.
