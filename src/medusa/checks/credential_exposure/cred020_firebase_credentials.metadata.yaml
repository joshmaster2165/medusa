title: Firebase Credential Exposure
category: credential_exposure
severity: high
description: >
  Detects Firebase API keys, service account data, or admin SDK
  credentials in MCP server configuration. Firebase credentials provide
  access to Firestore, Realtime Database, Authentication, and Cloud
  Storage services.
risk_explanation: >
  Firebase admin credentials bypass all security rules, granting
  unrestricted access to read, write, and delete data in Firestore and
  Realtime Database. Exposed admin SDK credentials can modify
  authentication records, impersonate users, and access all stored
  files. Even client API keys, while less dangerous, can be abused for
  quota exhaustion and data enumeration.
remediation: >
  Use Firebase Admin SDK with application default credentials instead of
  explicit key files. Store Firebase credentials in environment
  variables or secrets managers. Implement proper Firebase Security
  Rules as a defense-in-depth measure. Restrict API key usage to
  specific domains and APIs.
