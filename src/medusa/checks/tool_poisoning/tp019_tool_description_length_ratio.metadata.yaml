title: Abnormal Description-to-Name Length Ratio
category: tool_poisoning
severity: low
description: >
  Detects tools with suspiciously long descriptions relative to their
  tool name length. An extremely high description-to-name ratio may
  indicate that the description contains hidden instructions, encoded
  payloads, or excessive content designed to influence LLM behaviour
  beyond documenting the tool's legitimate purpose.
risk_explanation: >
  Abnormally long descriptions provide more surface area for embedding
  hidden instructions, prompt injection payloads, and social engineering
  content. While long descriptions alone are not malicious, they
  increase the probability that injected content goes unnoticed during
  review and provide more tokens for the LLM to process as instructions.
remediation: >
  Set a maximum description length threshold relative to tool
  complexity. Flag descriptions exceeding a configurable character limit
  (e.g. 2000 characters) for manual review. Compare description lengths
  across tools in the same server to identify outliers. Encourage
  concise, focused tool descriptions.
