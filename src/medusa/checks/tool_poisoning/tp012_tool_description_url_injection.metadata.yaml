title: URL Injection in Tool Descriptions
category: tool_poisoning
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects suspicious URLs embedded in tool descriptions that may be used
  for data exfiltration or phishing. Tool descriptions containing URLs
  to external services can direct the LLM to send sensitive data to
  attacker-controlled endpoints during tool invocation.
risk_explanation: >
  URLs in tool descriptions can instruct the LLM to fetch from or post
  data to external endpoints. An attacker can embed an exfiltration URL
  that receives sensitive context data, tool outputs, or user
  credentials as URL parameters. The LLM may follow URL-based
  instructions without user awareness, especially when the URL is
  presented as documentation.
remediation: >
  Scan tool descriptions for embedded URLs and validate them against an
  allowlist of trusted domains. Flag descriptions containing URLs with
  query parameters, IP addresses, or uncommon TLDs. Remove or neutralize
  URLs that are not essential for tool documentation. Implement content
  filtering to prevent the LLM from following description-embedded URLs.
