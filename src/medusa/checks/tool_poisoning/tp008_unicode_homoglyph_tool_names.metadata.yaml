title: Unicode Homoglyph Tool Names
category: tool_poisoning
severity: high
description: >
  Detects tool names that use Unicode homoglyph characters to visually
  impersonate legitimate tool names. Confusable characters such as
  Cyrillic 'a' (U+0430) in place of Latin 'a' (U+0061) make tool names
  appear identical to trusted tools while being technically different
  identifiers.
risk_explanation: >
  Homoglyph tool names trick both users and LLMs into invoking a
  malicious tool believing it to be a trusted one. The attacker's tool
  can intercept parameters meant for the legitimate tool, exfiltrate
  sensitive data, or return manipulated results. Visual inspection alone
  cannot distinguish homoglyph names from originals.
remediation: >
  Normalize all tool names to ASCII or a canonical Unicode form
  (NFC/NFKC) before registration. Reject tool names containing
  characters from mixed scripts (e.g. Latin mixed with Cyrillic).
  Implement confusable detection using Unicode Technical Standard #39
  security mechanisms.
