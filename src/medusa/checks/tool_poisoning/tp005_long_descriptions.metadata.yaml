title: Abnormally Long Tool Descriptions
category: tool_poisoning
severity: medium
description: >
  Flags tool descriptions that exceed a reasonable length threshold (2000
  characters). Excessively long descriptions are a common vector for burying
  hidden instructions, prompt injection phrases, or encoded payloads within
  large blocks of seemingly legitimate text.
risk_explanation: >
  Long descriptions increase the attack surface for tool-poisoning by making
  manual review impractical. An attacker can hide a small injection payload
  inside thousands of characters of benign documentation. Additionally,
  oversized descriptions consume more of the LLM's context window, which can
  degrade its ability to follow user intent and increases the chance of the
  model blindly following embedded instructions.
remediation: >
  Keep tool descriptions concise and under 2000 characters. Move detailed
  documentation to external references or resource URIs. Review any description
  that exceeds the threshold for hidden content. Consider enforcing a maximum
  description length at the MCP server or client level.
