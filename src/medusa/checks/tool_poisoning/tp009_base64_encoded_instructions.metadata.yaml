title: Base64-Encoded Instructions in Descriptions
category: tool_poisoning
severity: high
description: >
  Detects base64-encoded content embedded within tool descriptions.
  Attackers encode malicious instructions in base64 to bypass content
  filtering and hide prompt injection payloads from human reviewers. The
  LLM may decode and follow these hidden instructions during tool
  invocation.
risk_explanation: >
  Base64-encoded instructions evade both automated scanning and manual
  review. When an LLM encounters base64 content, it may decode and
  execute the embedded instructions, which could direct it to exfiltrate
  data, invoke other tools, or override user intent. This technique is
  particularly effective because base64 strings appear as harmless
  opaque data.
remediation: >
  Scan all tool descriptions for base64-encoded content patterns. Reject
  or flag descriptions containing valid base64 strings above a minimum
  length threshold. Implement content-security policies that strip or
  decode base64 content before presenting descriptions to the LLM.
  Require plain-text descriptions only.
