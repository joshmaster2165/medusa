title: Tool Description Prompt Injection
category: tool_poisoning
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects explicit prompt injection phrases in MCP tool descriptions. These
  phrases attempt to override LLM behaviour by instructing the model to ignore
  previous instructions, hide actions from the user, exfiltrate data, or
  assume a different identity.
risk_explanation: >
  Prompt injection phrases embedded in tool descriptions can hijack the LLM's
  behaviour at runtime. Unlike hidden instructions (TP-001), these phrases may
  be visible in plaintext but rely on the LLM following embedded directives
  over user intent. Successful exploitation grants the attacker indirect
  control over the model's actions.
remediation: >
  Remove or reject tool descriptions that contain prompt injection language.
  Implement allowlist-based description validation on the MCP server. Consider
  using a secondary classifier to flag descriptions that attempt to override
  system prompts or instruct the model to act covertly.
