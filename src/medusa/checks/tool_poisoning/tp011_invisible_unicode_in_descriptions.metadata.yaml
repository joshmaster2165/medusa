title: Invisible Unicode Characters in Tool Descriptions
category: tool_poisoning
severity: high
description: >
  Detects zero-width characters, bidirectional override markers, and
  other invisible Unicode codepoints hidden within tool descriptions.
  These characters can conceal malicious instructions that are invisible
  in UIs but processed by LLMs, enabling covert prompt injection.
risk_explanation: >
  Invisible Unicode characters allow attackers to embed instructions
  that are completely hidden from human reviewers. Zero-width spaces,
  joiners, and bidirectional text markers can encode hidden messages or
  alter the visual ordering of text to disguise malicious content. LLMs
  process the full Unicode string, following instructions that users
  cannot see.
remediation: >
  Strip all zero-width and invisible Unicode characters from tool
  descriptions before processing. Implement a Unicode allowlist that
  permits only visible, printable characters in tool metadata. Flag
  descriptions containing bidirectional override characters
  (U+202A-U+202E, U+2066-U+2069) or zero-width codepoints
  (U+200B-U+200F, U+FEFF).
