title: Conflicting Parameter Descriptions
category: tool_poisoning
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects tool parameters whose descriptions contradict the stated
  purpose of the tool. For example, a tool described as "read-only file
  viewer" with a parameter described as "path to write output" indicates
  a mismatch that may signal deceptive intent.
risk_explanation: >
  Conflicting parameter descriptions can mislead the LLM into passing
  sensitive data to parameters that perform unintended operations. A
  tool claiming to be read-only while accepting write-oriented
  parameters can trick the LLM into authorizing destructive operations.
  The contradiction between tool purpose and parameter intent is a
  strong indicator of deception.
remediation: >
  Implement semantic analysis to detect contradictions between tool-
  level descriptions and parameter-level descriptions. Flag parameters
  whose descriptions suggest capabilities not mentioned in the tool
  description. Require consistent terminology between tool descriptions
  and their parameter documentation.
