title: Recursive Tool Invocation Risk
category: tool_poisoning
severity: high
description: >
  Detects tool descriptions that encourage or instruct the LLM to invoke
  additional tools in a recursive or chained fashion. Malicious
  descriptions can create tool invocation loops or chains that escalate
  privileges, exfiltrate data across multiple steps, or cause denial of
  service.
risk_explanation: >
  Recursive tool invocation can amplify the impact of a single poisoned
  tool. An attacker's tool description instructs the LLM to call another
  tool with manipulated parameters, creating a chain that progressively
  escalates access or exfiltrates data in stages. Unbounded recursion
  can also exhaust resources, causing denial of service.
remediation: >
  Implement invocation depth limits for tool chains. Detect and flag
  tool descriptions that reference other tools by name or instruct the
  LLM to perform additional invocations. Require explicit user approval
  for each step in a tool invocation chain. Monitor for circular
  invocation patterns.
