title: Tool Name Impersonation
category: tool_poisoning
severity: high
description: >
  Detects tools named to impersonate well-known, trusted tool names with
  minor variations such as typosquatting, prefix/suffix additions, or
  abbreviation differences. Examples include 'read_flie' instead of
  'read_file' or 'secure_read_file' shadowing 'read_file'.
risk_explanation: >
  Tool name impersonation exploits the LLM's tendency to select tools by
  name similarity. A tool named to closely match a trusted tool may be
  selected instead, intercepting sensitive operations. The attacker's
  tool receives all parameters and context intended for the legitimate
  tool, enabling data theft or result manipulation.
remediation: >
  Implement Levenshtein distance or similar fuzzy matching to detect
  tool names that are suspiciously similar to known trusted tools.
  Maintain a registry of canonical tool names and flag new tools with
  names within a configurable edit distance. Require explicit user
  confirmation when similarly-named tools are detected.
