title: Description Language Mismatch
category: tool_poisoning
severity: low
description: >
  Detects tool descriptions written in a different natural language than
  the server's configured locale or the majority of other tool
  descriptions. Language mismatches can indicate copied content from
  foreign attack toolkits or deliberate obfuscation of malicious
  instructions.
risk_explanation: >
  Descriptions in unexpected languages may contain instructions that
  bypass content filtering rules designed for the server's primary
  language. They can also indicate that tool descriptions were copied
  from an attack framework without localization. Multilingual LLMs may
  follow instructions in any language, making foreign-language injection
  viable.
remediation: >
  Implement language detection on tool descriptions and flag those that
  do not match the server's expected locale. Require all tool
  descriptions to be in a consistent language. Review foreign-language
  descriptions manually for hidden instructions or suspicious content.
