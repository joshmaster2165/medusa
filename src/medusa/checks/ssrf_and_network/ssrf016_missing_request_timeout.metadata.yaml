title: Missing Request Timeout
category: ssrf_and_network
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server tools that make network requests without
  configuring timeouts. Missing timeouts allow requests to hang
  indefinitely, consuming server resources and potentially enabling
  denial-of-service attacks through slow-response techniques or
  connection exhaustion.
risk_explanation: >
  MCP tools without request timeouts are vulnerable to denial-of-service
  through slow-response attacks. An attacker can direct tool requests to
  a server that accepts connections but responds extremely slowly, tying
  up server threads or connections indefinitely. Over multiple requests,
  this exhausts the MCP server's connection pool and renders it unable
  to process legitimate tool invocations.
remediation: >
  Configure explicit connection and read timeouts for all network
  requests made by MCP tools. Set connection timeouts to 5-10 seconds
  and read timeouts to 30-60 seconds based on expected response times.
  Implement overall request duration limits that abort requests
  exceeding the maximum allowed time. Use asynchronous request patterns
  with timeout handling to prevent thread blocking.
