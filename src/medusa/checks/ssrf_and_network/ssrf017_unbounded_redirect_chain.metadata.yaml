title: Unbounded Redirect Chain
category: ssrf_and_network
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server tools that follow HTTP redirects without limiting
  the number of redirects in a chain. Unbounded redirect following can
  lead to infinite redirect loops, excessive resource consumption, and
  redirect-based SSRF attacks that gradually move through allowed
  domains to reach blocked targets.
risk_explanation: >
  Unbounded redirect chains can cause MCP tool requests to loop
  indefinitely, consuming server resources and causing denial of
  service. Additionally, multi-hop redirect chains can be used to
  gradually traverse from allowed domains through intermediate
  redirectors to reach blocked internal targets. Each hop in the chain
  may pass individual URL validation while the final destination
  violates security policy.
remediation: >
  Limit the maximum number of HTTP redirects followed by MCP tools to a
  small value such as 3-5. Validate each redirect target against the
  same SSRF protection rules applied to the original URL. Log the
  complete redirect chain for security monitoring. Consider disabling
  automatic redirect following entirely and handling redirects
  explicitly in tool logic.
