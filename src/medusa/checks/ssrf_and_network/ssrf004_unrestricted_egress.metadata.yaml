title: Unrestricted Network Egress
category: ssrf_and_network
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments where tools can make outbound network
  requests to any destination without egress filtering. Unrestricted
  egress allows MCP tools to contact arbitrary external services,
  exfiltrate data, or establish command-and-control channels.
risk_explanation: >
  Unrestricted network egress from MCP servers allows compromised or
  malicious tools to exfiltrate sensitive data to attacker-controlled
  endpoints, download additional payloads, establish reverse shells, or
  participate in attacks against third-party infrastructure. Without
  egress controls, there is no boundary limiting what an exploited MCP
  tool can reach on the network.
remediation: >
  Implement network-level egress filtering that restricts MCP server
  outbound connections to only required destinations. Use a web proxy or
  firewall with an allowlist of permitted domains and ports. Deploy
  network policies in container and Kubernetes environments. Monitor
  egress traffic for anomalous patterns. Regularly review and audit the
  egress allowlist.
