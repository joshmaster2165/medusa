title: Private IP Address Access
category: ssrf_and_network
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP server tools that allow requests to private IP address
  ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) without
  restriction. Tools accepting user-controlled URLs or hostnames can be
  abused to access internal network resources that should not be
  reachable from the MCP server.
risk_explanation: >
  Access to private IP ranges from MCP tools enables server-side request
  forgery (SSRF) attacks against internal infrastructure. An attacker
  can use MCP tool invocations to scan internal networks, access
  databases, reach administration panels, and interact with internal
  services that trust requests from the MCP server's network location.
  This can lead to full internal network compromise.
remediation: >
  Implement a URL validation layer that blocks requests to private IP
  address ranges (RFC 1918) and other reserved ranges. Apply validation
  after DNS resolution to prevent DNS rebinding bypasses. Use an
  allowlist of permitted external domains and IP ranges. Deploy network-
  level egress filtering to enforce restrictions independent of
  application logic.
