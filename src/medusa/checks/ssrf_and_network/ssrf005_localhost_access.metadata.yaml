title: Localhost Access
category: ssrf_and_network
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server tools that allow requests to localhost addresses
  including 127.0.0.1, ::1, and the localhost hostname. Localhost access
  from MCP tools enables exploitation of services running on the same
  host as the MCP server, including databases, admin interfaces, and
  debugging endpoints.
risk_explanation: >
  Services bound to localhost are typically configured without
  authentication because they are assumed to be inaccessible from the
  network. MCP tools that can access 127.0.0.1 or localhost bypass this
  assumption, reaching databases, caches, admin panels, and debugging
  endpoints that are not designed for external access. This can lead to
  data theft, configuration modification, and remote code execution.
remediation: >
  Block all MCP tool requests to loopback addresses including
  127.0.0.0/8, ::1, and the localhost hostname. Apply this restriction
  at both the application and network levels. Validate resolved IP
  addresses against the loopback range after DNS resolution. If specific
  localhost services must be accessed, use a tightly scoped allowlist
  with authentication requirements.
