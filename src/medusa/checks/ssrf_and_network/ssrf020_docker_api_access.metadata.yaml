title: Docker API Access
category: ssrf_and_network
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP server tools that can access the Docker daemon API,
  typically exposed on /var/run/docker.sock (Unix socket) or TCP port
  2375/2376. Access to the Docker API enables container escape, host
  filesystem access, and arbitrary container creation with elevated
  privileges.
risk_explanation: >
  Docker API access from MCP tools is equivalent to root access on the
  host system. An attacker can create privileged containers with host
  filesystem mounts, execute commands in existing containers, read
  container logs containing secrets, and modify running containers.
  Through Docker API access, an attacker can escape the MCP server
  container, access the host operating system, and compromise all other
  containers on the same host.
remediation: >
  Block MCP tool access to the Docker socket path (/var/run/docker.sock)
  and Docker TCP API ports (2375, 2376). Never mount the Docker socket
  into MCP server containers. Use rootless container runtimes that do
  not expose a privileged daemon socket. Implement network policies that
  block access to Docker API ports. If Docker API access is required,
  use Docker API authorization plugins with strict access controls.
