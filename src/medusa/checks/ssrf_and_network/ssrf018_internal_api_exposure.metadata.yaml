title: Internal API Exposure
category: ssrf_and_network
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server tools that can access internal API endpoints
  intended only for service-to-service communication. Internal APIs
  typically lack authentication and authorization controls because they
  are assumed to be unreachable from external sources.
risk_explanation: >
  Internal APIs accessed through MCP tool SSRF often have no
  authentication because they rely on network isolation for security. An
  attacker who can reach these APIs through MCP tools gains access to
  administrative functions, data manipulation endpoints, and service
  configuration interfaces. This can lead to complete compromise of
  internal services and the data they manage.
remediation: >
  Block MCP tool access to internal API endpoints through URL validation
  and network segmentation. Require authentication on all internal APIs
  regardless of network location. Implement service mesh or zero-trust
  networking that validates identity for every request. Maintain an
  inventory of internal APIs and ensure they are excluded from the MCP
  tool egress allowlist.
