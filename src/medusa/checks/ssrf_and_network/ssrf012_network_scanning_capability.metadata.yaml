title: Network Scanning Capability
category: ssrf_and_network
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server tools that can be abused to perform network
  scanning by making requests to arbitrary hosts and analyzing response
  characteristics. Tools that accept hostnames or IP addresses as
  parameters can be systematically used to discover live hosts on
  internal networks.
risk_explanation: >
  MCP tools with network scanning capability allow attackers to map
  internal network topology from an external position. By submitting
  requests to sequential IP addresses or common hostnames, an attacker
  can identify live hosts, determine which services are running, and
  build a target list for further exploitation. This reconnaissance is
  the first step in most internal network attacks.
remediation: >
  Restrict MCP tool network access to a defined set of permitted
  endpoints. Implement rate limiting on network requests to prevent
  rapid scanning. Monitor for sequential or systematic request patterns
  that indicate scanning activity. Use uniform error responses that do
  not reveal whether a host exists or a port is open. Deploy network
  segmentation to limit the scan surface accessible from the MCP server.
