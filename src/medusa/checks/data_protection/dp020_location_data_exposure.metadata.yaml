title: Location Data Exposure
category: data_protection
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that access or expose geographic location data.
  Location data can reveal home addresses, workplace locations, travel
  patterns, and daily routines.
risk_explanation: >
  Location data is classified as sensitive personal data under most
  privacy regulations. Continuous or historical location access reveals
  home and work addresses, travel patterns, daily routines, and physical
  movements. This data can be used for stalking, physical security
  threats, or targeted attacks.
remediation: >
  Require explicit user consent before accessing location data.
  Implement precision limiting that reduces location accuracy to the
  minimum needed (e.g. city-level instead of exact coordinates). Avoid
  storing location history and implement automatic expiration for any
  cached location data.
