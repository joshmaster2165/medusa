title: Cross-Origin Data Sharing
category: data_protection
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that share data across origin boundaries without
  explicit user consent. Data returned by one tool or resource may be
  forwarded to a different server or domain without the user's
  knowledge.
risk_explanation: >
  Cross-origin data sharing without consent enables data exfiltration
  attacks where a malicious MCP server can harvest data produced by
  legitimate servers in the same client session. This violates the
  principle of origin isolation and can expose sensitive business data
  to untrusted third parties.
remediation: >
  Implement origin-aware data boundaries that prevent tool outputs from
  being forwarded to servers on different origins without explicit user
  consent. Use data tagging to track the origin of each piece of data
  and enforce sharing policies at the client level.
