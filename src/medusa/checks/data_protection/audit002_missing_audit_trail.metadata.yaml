title: Missing Audit Trail Capability
category: data_protection
severity: medium
description: >
  Checks whether the MCP server declares a "logging" key in its capabilities
  object. Servers that do not advertise logging support lack a structured
  audit trail for tool invocations and resource access.
risk_explanation: >
  Without an advertised logging capability, there is no guarantee that tool
  calls are being recorded. This makes it impossible to detect misuse,
  investigate security incidents, or satisfy compliance audit requirements.
remediation: >
  Enable the logging capability in the MCP server's initialize response.
  Ensure that every tool invocation and resource access is logged with
  sufficient detail for forensic analysis (timestamp, caller, parameters,
  result summary).
