title: Biometric Data Handling
category: data_protection
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that process biometric data such as fingerprints,
  facial features, voice prints, or iris scans. Biometric data is
  immutable and cannot be changed if compromised.
risk_explanation: >
  Biometric data is uniquely sensitive because it is immutable. Unlike
  passwords or tokens, compromised biometric data cannot be reset or
  rotated. A breach of biometric data creates permanent identity theft
  risks and violates biometric privacy laws such as BIPA, GDPR special
  categories, and state-level biometric legislation.
remediation: >
  Avoid processing raw biometric data through MCP tools whenever
  possible. If biometric processing is required, use one-way hashing or
  template- based matching that prevents reconstruction of the original
  biometric. Implement strict access controls, encryption, and audit
  logging for all biometric data handling. Obtain explicit informed
  consent.
