title: Missing Data Classification on Resources
category: data_protection
severity: low
description: >
  Checks whether MCP resources declare a mimeType or include data
  classification keywords in their description. Resources without any
  classification signal make it impossible for LLM clients to apply
  appropriate handling policies.
risk_explanation: >
  Without data classification metadata, LLM clients cannot distinguish
  between public documentation and confidential records. This increases the
  risk of accidental data leakage when the model includes resource content
  in its responses.
remediation: >
  Add a mimeType to every resource definition. Include a data classification
  keyword (e.g. "public", "internal", "confidential", "sensitive",
  "restricted") in the resource description to indicate the sensitivity
  level of the content.
