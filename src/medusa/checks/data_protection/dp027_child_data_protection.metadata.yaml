title: Child Data Protection (COPPA)
category: data_protection
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that may process children's data without
  implementing COPPA-required protections. Tools accessible to children
  or processing data about minors must comply with enhanced privacy
  requirements.
risk_explanation: >
  Processing children's data without COPPA compliance exposes the
  organisation to federal enforcement actions and significant fines.
  Children are especially vulnerable to data exploitation, and their
  data requires enhanced protections including verifiable parental
  consent, data minimization, and strict purpose limitation.
remediation: >
  Implement age verification mechanisms for MCP tools that may be
  accessed by children. Obtain verifiable parental consent before
  processing any data from users under 13. Apply strict data
  minimization and purpose limitation. Provide parents with access to
  and deletion of their children's data. Ensure compliance with COPPA,
  GDPR Article 8, and applicable state laws.
