title: Excessive Logging of PII
category: data_protection
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server configurations or code patterns that write
  personally identifiable information to log files. PII in logs creates
  secondary exposure vectors and complicates regulatory compliance.
risk_explanation: >
  Log files are often stored with weaker access controls than primary
  data stores and may be shipped to third-party log aggregation
  services. PII in logs can be exposed through log viewer access, log
  file backups, or log aggregation platform breaches, creating
  compliance violations under GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA.
remediation: >
  Implement log scrubbing that removes or masks PII before writing to
  log files. Use structured logging with explicit field allow-lists.
  Configure log frameworks to redact sensitive fields automatically.
  Audit log outputs regularly for PII leakage.
