title: Clipboard Data Exposure Risk
category: data_protection
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP tools with capabilities to read or write clipboard
  contents without explicit user awareness. Clipboard access can expose
  passwords, sensitive text, and copied credentials to the MCP server.
risk_explanation: >
  The clipboard frequently contains sensitive data such as passwords,
  API keys, personal messages, and financial information that users copy
  during normal workflows. An MCP tool that silently reads clipboard
  contents can exfiltrate this data without the user's knowledge,
  creating a covert data theft channel.
remediation: >
  Require explicit user confirmation before any clipboard access.
  Display clear notifications when clipboard data is read or written.
  Implement clipboard access as a gated permission that must be
  explicitly granted by the user. Log all clipboard access events for
  audit purposes.
