title: Financial Data Exposure
category: data_protection
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that handle financial records, banking data, or
  payment information without appropriate protection. Financial data
  requires PCI-DSS compliance and strong security controls.
risk_explanation: >
  Exposure of financial data including account numbers, transaction
  histories, credit card details, and banking credentials enables direct
  financial fraud. Financial data breaches trigger regulatory penalties
  under PCI-DSS, SOX, and financial services regulations, and cause
  immediate monetary harm to affected individuals.
remediation: >
  Implement PCI-DSS compliant data handling for all financial MCP tools.
  Never store full credit card numbers or CVVs. Use tokenisation for
  payment data and ensure all financial data is encrypted in transit and
  at rest. Implement transaction monitoring and anomaly detection for
  financial operations.
