title: Missing Encryption in Transit
category: data_protection
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server connections that transmit data without encryption.
  Unencrypted transport channels expose data to interception via man-in-
  the-middle attacks on the network.
risk_explanation: >
  Data transmitted in plaintext over the network can be intercepted,
  read, and modified by any attacker with access to the network path.
  This includes tool invocation parameters, response data, credentials,
  and PII. Even localhost connections can be intercepted by malware
  running on the same host.
remediation: >
  Enforce TLS for all MCP server communications. Use TLS 1.2 or higher
  with strong cipher suites. For stdio-based servers, ensure any network
  calls made by the server to backend services also use encrypted
  transport. Consider mutual TLS for server-to-server communication.
