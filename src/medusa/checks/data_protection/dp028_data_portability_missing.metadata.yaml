title: Missing Data Portability
category: data_protection
severity: low
description: >
  Checks whether the MCP server provides a mechanism for users to export
  their data in a portable format. Data portability is a right under
  GDPR and similar regulations.
risk_explanation: >
  Without data portability, users are locked into a specific MCP server
  or platform and cannot exercise their right to receive their data in a
  structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. This creates
  vendor lock-in and violates GDPR Article 20 data portability
  requirements.
remediation: >
  Implement a data export mechanism that allows users to download their
  data in standard formats such as JSON, CSV, or XML. Ensure the export
  includes all user-provided data and any derived data that is subject
  to portability rights. Provide the export capability through a
  documented API endpoint or user interface.
