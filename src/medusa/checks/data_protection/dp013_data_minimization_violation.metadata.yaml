title: Data Minimization Violation
category: data_protection
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that collect or request more data than is necessary
  for their stated purpose. Data minimization is a core privacy
  principle that limits the amount of personal data collected and
  processed.
risk_explanation: >
  Collecting excessive data increases the blast radius of a data breach
  and violates the principle of data minimization required by GDPR and
  other regulations. Tools that request unnecessary fields create larger
  attack surfaces and increase the volume of sensitive data that must be
  protected.
remediation: >
  Review each tool's input schema and remove fields that are not
  strictly necessary for the tool's function. Implement purpose
  limitation by documenting why each field is collected. Use progressive
  data collection where additional fields are requested only when
  needed.
