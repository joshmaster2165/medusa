title: Browser History Access
category: data_protection
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that access browser history, bookmarks, or browsing
  data. Browser history reveals private browsing patterns, visited
  sites, and user interests.
risk_explanation: >
  Browser history contains a detailed record of user activity including
  visited websites, search queries, and login pages. Access to this data
  enables profiling, targeted phishing, and exposure of sensitive
  browsing patterns such as medical research, financial activities, or
  personal interests.
remediation: >
  Restrict browser history access to tools that have a clearly
  documented and justified need. Require explicit user consent before
  granting browser history access. Implement time-bounded access that
  only returns history from a specific, user-approved time window. Log
  all browser data access events.
