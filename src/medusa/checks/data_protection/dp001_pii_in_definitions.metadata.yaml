title: PII in Tool/Resource/Prompt Definitions
category: data_protection
severity: high
description: >
  Detects personally identifiable information (PII) such as email addresses,
  phone numbers, SSNs, credit card numbers, and IP addresses embedded in MCP
  tool descriptions, resource descriptions/URIs, prompt descriptions, and
  inputSchema fields (description, default, enum values).
risk_explanation: >
  PII hardcoded in server definitions can be leaked to any LLM client that
  connects. This exposes sensitive data to unintended consumers and may
  violate privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.
remediation: >
  Remove all PII from tool, resource, and prompt definitions. Use placeholder
  values or dynamic references instead of real personal data. Implement a
  pre-publish review process that scans definitions for PII before deployment.
