title: Keylogger Risk
category: data_protection
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP tools with keystroke capture capabilities. Keylogging is
  one of the most invasive forms of surveillance and can capture
  passwords, private communications, and all user input.
risk_explanation: >
  Keystroke capture records every key pressed by the user, including
  passwords, credit card numbers, private messages, and authentication
  codes. A malicious MCP tool with keylogging capabilities has complete
  access to all user input across all applications, making it one of the
  most dangerous attack vectors.
remediation: >
  Block all MCP tools that request global keyboard input monitoring
  capabilities. Only allow keyboard input capture within the scope of
  the MCP client application itself. Implement operating system-level
  protections that prevent MCP servers from registering global keyboard
  hooks.
