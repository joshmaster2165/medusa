title: Excessive Tool/Resource/Prompt Counts (Over-Sharing)
category: data_protection
severity: medium
description: >
  Checks whether the MCP server exposes an excessive number of tools,
  resources, or prompts. Servers that over-share increase the attack surface
  available to connected LLM clients and raise the risk of unintended
  tool invocations.
risk_explanation: >
  A large number of exposed tools, resources, and prompts expands the
  attack surface significantly. LLMs may invoke unintended tools due to
  ambiguous names, and attackers can exploit the breadth of exposed
  functionality to chain multiple tools into harmful workflows.
remediation: >
  Apply the principle of least privilege to MCP server definitions. Only
  expose tools, resources, and prompts that are required for the intended
  use case. Use capability scoping or role-based access to restrict what
  each client can see.
