title: Missing Right to Deletion
category: data_protection
severity: medium
description: >
  Checks whether the MCP server provides a mechanism for users to
  request deletion of their personal data. The right to erasure is a
  fundamental requirement under GDPR and CCPA.
risk_explanation: >
  Without a deletion mechanism, the organisation cannot comply with data
  erasure requests required by GDPR (right to be forgotten), CCPA (right
  to delete), and similar regulations. Failure to honour deletion
  requests results in regulatory fines and continued risk of data
  exposure for data that should have been removed.
remediation: >
  Implement a data deletion mechanism that allows users to request
  erasure of their personal data. Ensure deletion propagates to all
  storage locations including backups, caches, logs, and third-party
  processors. Provide confirmation of deletion and maintain records of
  deletion requests for compliance purposes.
