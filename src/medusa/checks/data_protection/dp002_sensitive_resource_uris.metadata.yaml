title: Sensitive File Paths in Resource URIs
category: data_protection
severity: high
description: >
  Detects resource URIs that reference sensitive file paths such as private
  keys, credential files, SSH directories, and cloud provider configuration
  files. Also scans for hardcoded secrets embedded directly in URI strings.
risk_explanation: >
  Exposing resources that point to sensitive files allows any connected LLM
  client to read private keys, credentials, and configuration secrets. This
  can lead to full account compromise and lateral movement across systems.
remediation: >
  Remove resources that expose sensitive file paths. If access to secrets is
  required, use a dedicated secrets manager and expose only opaque references.
  Restrict resource URIs to application-specific data directories.
