title: Health Data Exposure
category: data_protection
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that handle health or medical data without
  appropriate safeguards. Health data is subject to strict regulatory
  requirements including HIPAA, HITECH, and GDPR special categories.
risk_explanation: >
  Health and medical data is among the most sensitive categories of
  personal information. Exposure of health records, diagnoses,
  prescriptions, or treatment plans can lead to discrimination,
  insurance denial, social stigma, and identity theft. Violations of
  health data regulations carry severe penalties including criminal
  prosecution.
remediation: >
  Implement HIPAA-compliant data handling for all health-related MCP
  tools. Apply end-to-end encryption, strict access controls, and
  comprehensive audit logging. Ensure business associate agreements are
  in place with all data processors. Use de-identification techniques
  compliant with HIPAA Safe Harbor or Expert Determination methods.
