title: Screenshot Capture Risk
category: data_protection
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP tools with capabilities to capture screen content.
  Screenshot capture can expose any visible information including
  private messages, banking details, medical records, and authentication
  tokens.
risk_explanation: >
  Screen capture provides access to all visible information on the
  user's display, regardless of the application or context. A malicious
  MCP tool with screenshot capabilities can capture sensitive
  information from any application, including banking portals, medical
  systems, private messages, and authentication screens.
remediation: >
  Restrict screenshot capabilities to explicitly approved use cases.
  Require user confirmation before each capture. Implement capture
  region limiting so that only the relevant application window is
  captured. Apply automatic redaction of detected sensitive content in
  captured images.
