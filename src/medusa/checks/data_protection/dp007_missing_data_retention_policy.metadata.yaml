title: Missing Data Retention Policy
category: data_protection
severity: medium
description: >
  Checks whether the MCP server defines a data retention and lifecycle
  policy. Servers that store or cache data without a defined retention
  period risk accumulating sensitive information indefinitely.
risk_explanation: >
  Without a data retention policy, sensitive data processed by the MCP
  server may persist in caches, logs, or temporary storage long after it
  is needed. This increases the blast radius of a data breach and may
  violate regulatory requirements that mandate data deletion after a
  defined period.
remediation: >
  Define and enforce a data retention policy for all data processed by
  the MCP server. Implement automated purging of cached data, logs, and
  temporary files after the retention period expires. Document the
  retention policy and make it available for compliance audits.
