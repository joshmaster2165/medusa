title: Missing Data Anonymization
category: data_protection
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that handle sensitive datasets without applying
  anonymization or pseudonymization techniques. Raw sensitive data
  flowing through the MCP pipeline increases exposure risk.
risk_explanation: >
  Without anonymization, sensitive data retains its full identifying
  power throughout the processing pipeline. If any component in the
  chain is compromised, the attacker gains access to fully identifiable
  data. Anonymization reduces the value of stolen data and limits the
  scope of privacy breaches.
remediation: >
  Apply anonymization or pseudonymization to sensitive datasets before
  processing. Use techniques such as k-anonymity, differential privacy,
  or data masking. Ensure anonymization is applied as early as possible
  in the data pipeline and that re-identification is not feasible from
  the anonymised output.
