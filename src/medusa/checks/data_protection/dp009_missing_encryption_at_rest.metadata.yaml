title: Missing Encryption at Rest
category: data_protection
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server configurations where stored data, caches, or
  persistent state lack encryption at rest. Unencrypted data on disk is
  vulnerable to theft if the host is compromised.
risk_explanation: >
  Data stored without encryption at rest can be read by anyone with
  filesystem access. If the MCP server host is compromised, an attacker
  gains immediate access to all stored data including credentials, PII,
  and business-critical information without needing to break any
  cryptographic protections.
remediation: >
  Enable encryption at rest for all persistent storage used by the MCP
  server. Use platform-provided encryption (e.g. LUKS, FileVault, AWS
  EBS encryption) or application-level encryption with properly managed
  keys. Ensure encryption keys are stored separately from the encrypted
  data.
