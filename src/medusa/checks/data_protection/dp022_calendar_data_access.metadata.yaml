title: Calendar Data Access
category: data_protection
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that access calendar events, schedules, or
  appointment data. Calendar data reveals meeting participants, topics,
  locations, and daily routines.
risk_explanation: >
  Calendar data exposes meeting schedules, participant lists, meeting
  topics and agendas, physical locations, and daily routines. This
  information enables social engineering attacks, reveals business
  relationships, and can be used to plan physical intrusions when the
  user is known to be away.
remediation: >
  Require explicit user consent before accessing calendar data.
  Implement granular access that allows sharing specific calendars or
  date ranges rather than full calendar access. Apply data minimization
  by only accessing the calendar fields needed for the tool's function.
