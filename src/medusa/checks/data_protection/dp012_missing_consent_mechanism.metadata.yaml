title: Missing Data Consent Mechanism
category: data_protection
severity: medium
description: >
  Checks whether the MCP server provides a mechanism for obtaining user
  consent before processing personal data. Servers that process data
  without consent violate privacy-by-design principles.
risk_explanation: >
  Processing personal data without user consent violates GDPR, CCPA, and
  other privacy regulations. Without a consent mechanism, users cannot
  make informed decisions about how their data is used, and the
  organisation faces regulatory fines and reputational damage.
remediation: >
  Implement a consent mechanism that informs users about data processing
  activities and obtains explicit consent before processing begins.
  Provide granular consent options for different data processing
  purposes. Record consent decisions for audit purposes and allow users
  to withdraw consent.
