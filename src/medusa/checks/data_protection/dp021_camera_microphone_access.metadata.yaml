title: Camera/Microphone Access
category: data_protection
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP tools with audio or video capture capabilities. Camera and
  microphone access enables surveillance of the user's physical
  environment.
risk_explanation: >
  Camera and microphone access enables real-time surveillance of the
  user's physical environment. A malicious MCP tool can record
  conversations, capture video of the user and their surroundings, and
  observe private activities. This represents one of the most severe
  privacy violations possible.
remediation: >
  Block all MCP tools that request camera or microphone access unless
  explicitly required and user-approved. Implement hardware-level
  indicators (e.g. LED lights) that activate during capture. Require
  per-session consent and provide immediate revocation capabilities. Log
  all audio/video capture events.
