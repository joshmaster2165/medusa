title: Contact Data Access
category: data_protection
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that access contacts, address books, or contact
  databases. Contact data contains PII of third parties who have not
  consented to data processing.
risk_explanation: >
  Contact data includes names, phone numbers, email addresses, and
  physical addresses of the user's contacts. Accessing this data exposes
  the PII of third parties who have not consented to data processing,
  creating GDPR violations and enabling social engineering attacks
  against the user's contacts.
remediation: >
  Require explicit user consent before accessing contact data. Implement
  granular access controls that allow users to share specific contacts
  rather than the entire address book. Apply data minimization by only
  accessing the specific contact fields needed for the tool's function.
