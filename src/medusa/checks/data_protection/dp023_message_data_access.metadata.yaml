title: Message/Chat Data Access
category: data_protection
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that access messaging history, chat logs, email
  content, or other communication data. Message data contains private
  conversations and potentially sensitive information.
risk_explanation: >
  Messaging and chat data contains private conversations, shared files,
  business discussions, and personal communications. Access to this data
  exposes confidential information, trade secrets, personal
  relationships, and sensitive topics that users reasonably expect to
  remain private.
remediation: >
  Require explicit user consent before accessing any messaging data.
  Implement conversation-level access controls rather than blanket
  access to all messages. Apply time-bounded access windows and log all
  message data access events. Never cache or persist accessed message
  content beyond the immediate processing need.
