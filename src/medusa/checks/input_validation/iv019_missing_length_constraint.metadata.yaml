title: Missing Input Length Constraint
category: input_validation
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects string parameters in tool schemas without maxLength
  constraints. Unbounded string parameters allow attackers to submit
  extremely large inputs that cause memory exhaustion, buffer overflows,
  or denial of service through excessive processing.
risk_explanation: >
  Without length constraints, an attacker can submit megabytes of data
  in a single parameter, causing memory exhaustion on the server. Large
  inputs can also trigger pathological behaviour in string processing
  algorithms, regex engines, and database queries. The absence of limits
  is itself a vulnerability indicator.
remediation: >
  Add maxLength constraints to all string parameters in tool schemas.
  Set limits appropriate to the parameter's purpose (e.g. 255 for names,
  2048 for URLs). Implement server-side length validation independent of
  schema constraints. Set global request size limits at the transport
  layer.
