title: Regular Expression DoS (ReDoS)
category: input_validation
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects tool parameters used in regular expression matching without
  complexity limits. User-controlled input in regex patterns or matched
  against vulnerable regex patterns can cause catastrophic backtracking,
  leading to denial of service.
risk_explanation: >
  ReDoS attacks exploit regular expressions with exponential
  backtracking behaviour. A crafted input string can cause the regex
  engine to consume 100% CPU for minutes or hours, effectively denying
  service. Common vulnerable patterns include nested quantifiers like
  (a+)+ and overlapping alternations.
remediation: >
  Never use user-supplied input directly as regex patterns. Set
  execution time limits on regex matching operations. Use regex engines
  with linear-time guarantees (RE2, rust-regex). Review all regex
  patterns for catastrophic backtracking using tools like rxxr2 or safe-
  regex. Implement input length limits for strings matched against
  regex.
