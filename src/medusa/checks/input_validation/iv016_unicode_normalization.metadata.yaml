title: Unicode Normalization Bypass
category: input_validation
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects input validation that can be bypassed via Unicode
  normalization transformations. Characters that appear different in
  their composed and decomposed forms can bypass security filters while
  being normalized to dangerous values by the processing system.
risk_explanation: >
  Unicode normalization can transform filtered characters into dangerous
  equivalents after validation. For example, the fullwidth solidus
  (U+FF0F) normalizes to a regular slash (/), bypassing path traversal
  filters. The validation check passes the pre-normalized form while the
  application processes the post-normalized dangerous form.
remediation: >
  Apply Unicode normalization (NFC or NFKC) to all input before
  validation, not after. Validate against the normalized form to ensure
  filters see the same representation as the processing logic. Reject
  input containing non-ASCII characters when only ASCII is expected. Use
  Unicode-aware validation libraries.
