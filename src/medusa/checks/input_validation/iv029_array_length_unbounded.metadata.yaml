title: Unbounded Array Length
category: input_validation
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects array-type tool parameters without maxItems constraints.
  Unbounded arrays allow attackers to submit millions of items, causing
  memory exhaustion, excessive processing time, and denial of service on
  the MCP server.
risk_explanation: >
  Array parameters without length limits enable denial of service by
  submitting arrays with millions of elements. Processing large arrays
  consumes memory and CPU proportionally. Database operations that
  iterate over array parameters can generate millions of queries.
  Unbounded arrays in nested structures compound the resource
  consumption exponentially.
remediation: >
  Add maxItems constraints to all array parameters in tool schemas. Set
  limits appropriate to the parameter's purpose. Implement server-side
  array length validation independent of schema constraints. Set global
  request payload size limits at the transport layer to prevent
  oversized array submissions.
