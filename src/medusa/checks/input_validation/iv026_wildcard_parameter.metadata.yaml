title: Wildcard Parameter Matching
category: input_validation
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects tool parameters that accept wildcard patterns (*, ?, **)
  without restrictions. Unrestricted glob or wildcard parameters can
  match unintended files, directories, or resources, expanding the
  operation scope beyond user intent.
risk_explanation: >
  Wildcard parameters can be exploited to operate on more resources than
  intended. A parameter accepting * in a file deletion tool can match
  all files in a directory. Recursive wildcards (**) can traverse entire
  directory trees. The attacker leverages wildcards to escalate the
  scope of an operation from a single resource to many.
remediation: >
  Restrict wildcard patterns to specific directories or resource sets.
  Implement maximum match limits for wildcard expansion. Require
  explicit confirmation when wildcards match more than a threshold
  number of resources. Validate wildcard patterns against an allowlist
  of safe matching contexts.
