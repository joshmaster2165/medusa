title: Insecure Default Credentials
category: server_hardening
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that ship with default usernames, passwords, API
  keys, or tokens that are documented, predictable, or shared across all
  installations. Default credentials are the most common entry point for
  server compromise.
risk_explanation: >
  Default credentials are publicly known and immediately exploited by
  automated scanning tools. Attackers maintain databases of default
  credentials for common software and continuously scan for servers
  using them. An MCP server with default credentials can be fully
  compromised within minutes of deployment, as no vulnerability
  exploitation is required, just authentication with known values.
remediation: >
  Never ship MCP servers with default credentials. Force credential
  creation during initial setup with complexity requirements. Generate
  unique random credentials per installation if defaults are needed for
  bootstrapping. Implement first-run setup that requires credential
  change before the server accepts client connections. Detect and alert
  on use of known default credentials.
