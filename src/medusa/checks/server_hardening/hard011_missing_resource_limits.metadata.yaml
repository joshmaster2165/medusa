title: Missing Server Resource Limits
category: server_hardening
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that do not enforce limits on system resource
  consumption including memory usage, CPU time, file descriptor count,
  disk space, and network connections. Without resource limits, a single
  request can consume all available server resources.
risk_explanation: >
  Missing resource limits enable denial-of-service attacks where a
  single crafted request or a small number of concurrent requests
  exhaust all available server resources. Memory exhaustion crashes the
  server, CPU exhaustion makes it unresponsive, file descriptor
  exhaustion prevents new connections, and disk exhaustion blocks
  logging and data persistence.
remediation: >
  Configure operating system-level resource limits for the MCP server
  process using cgroups, ulimits, or container resource constraints.
  Implement application-level limits for request processing time,
  response size, and concurrent operation count. Set per-client resource
  quotas. Monitor resource usage and alert on abnormal consumption
  patterns.
