title: Insecure File Permissions
category: server_hardening
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server installations with overly permissive file
  permissions on configuration files, credential stores, log files, and
  server binaries. World-readable or world-writable permissions allow
  unauthorized access and modification of server components.
risk_explanation: >
  Insecure file permissions allow local users or compromised processes
  to read sensitive configuration including credentials, modify server
  binaries to inject backdoors, alter configuration to weaken security,
  or read log files containing sensitive information. In shared hosting
  or container environments, file permission issues can enable cross-
  tenant attacks and privilege escalation.
remediation: >
  Set restrictive file permissions on all MCP server files. Make
  configuration files readable only by the server process user. Protect
  credential files with permissions 600 or more restrictive. Make server
  binaries and scripts read-only to prevent modification. Use a
  dedicated service account for the MCP server process with minimal file
  system permissions.
