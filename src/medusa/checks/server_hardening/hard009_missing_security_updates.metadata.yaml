title: Missing Security Updates
category: server_hardening
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP servers running outdated versions of their runtime,
  framework, or dependencies that have known security vulnerabilities.
  Missing security patches leave the server exposed to publicly
  disclosed exploits with available proof-of-concept code.
risk_explanation: >
  Known vulnerabilities in outdated software are actively exploited at
  scale. Once a CVE is published, exploit code is typically available
  within hours and automated scanning begins within days. Servers
  running unpatched software with known vulnerabilities are trivially
  compromised using publicly available exploit tools. The longer a patch
  is delayed, the more likely exploitation becomes.
remediation: >
  Implement a regular update schedule for the MCP server and all its
  dependencies. Use dependency scanning tools to detect known
  vulnerabilities. Set up automated alerts for security advisories
  affecting server components. Prioritize critical and high severity
  patches for immediate deployment. Maintain an inventory of all server
  components and their versions.
