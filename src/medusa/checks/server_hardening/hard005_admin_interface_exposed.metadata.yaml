title: Admin Interface Exposed
category: server_hardening
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that expose administrative or management
  interfaces to the same network or transport as client-facing
  endpoints. Admin interfaces provide elevated capabilities including
  server configuration, user management, and diagnostic access.
risk_explanation: >
  Exposed admin interfaces provide attackers with high-value targets
  that, if compromised, grant full control over the MCP server. Admin
  endpoints typically allow modifying server configuration, managing
  tool registrations, accessing diagnostic data, and controlling user
  permissions. Even with authentication, exposing admin interfaces
  increases the risk of brute force attacks and credential stuffing.
remediation: >
  Separate admin interfaces onto a dedicated management network or
  transport that is not accessible to regular MCP clients. Implement
  additional authentication requirements for admin access such as multi-
  factor authentication. Restrict admin interface access to specific IP
  addresses or VPN connections. Monitor and alert on all admin interface
  access attempts.
