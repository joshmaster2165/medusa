title: Exposed Version Information
category: server_hardening
severity: low
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that expose version information in response
  headers, error messages, capability declarations, or server metadata.
  Version information helps attackers identify specific software
  releases and their known vulnerabilities.
risk_explanation: >
  Exposed version information enables targeted attacks by allowing
  attackers to look up known vulnerabilities for the exact software
  version in use. Without version information, attackers must attempt
  exploits blindly which is less efficient and more likely to trigger
  detection. Version fingerprinting is a standard reconnaissance
  technique in the early stages of an attack.
remediation: >
  Remove version strings from all server responses, headers, and
  metadata. Configure the MCP server and its HTTP transport to suppress
  version headers such as Server and X-Powered-By. Review capability
  declarations and server info responses for version leakage. Use
  generic identifiers that do not reveal specific version numbers.
