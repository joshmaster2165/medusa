title: Missing Request Validation
category: server_hardening
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that do not validate the structure, content type,
  and size of incoming requests at the transport level before
  processing. Missing request validation allows malformed, oversized, or
  incorrectly typed requests to reach application logic.
risk_explanation: >
  Without request validation, malformed requests can trigger parsing
  errors that crash the server or leak implementation details. Oversized
  requests can exhaust memory. Incorrectly typed content can exploit
  parser vulnerabilities. Missing validation at the transport level
  means each handler must independently validate requests, leading to
  inconsistent protection.
remediation: >
  Implement request validation at the transport boundary that checks
  content type, content length, request structure, and character
  encoding before passing requests to handlers. Set maximum request size
  limits. Validate that request content matches the declared content
  type. Reject malformed requests with generic error messages. Log
  rejected requests for security monitoring.
