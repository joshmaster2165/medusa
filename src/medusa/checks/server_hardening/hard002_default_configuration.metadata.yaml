title: Default Configuration in Production
category: server_hardening
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP servers deployed with default configuration values that
  are intended for development or testing. Default configurations
  typically use weak security settings, permissive access controls, and
  debug-friendly options that are inappropriate for production.
risk_explanation: >
  Default configurations are publicly documented and well-known to
  attackers. Default ports, paths, credentials, and security settings
  provide a predictable attack surface. Servers deployed with default
  configurations often have overly permissive access controls, disabled
  authentication, verbose logging that leaks information, and relaxed
  rate limits that enable abuse.
remediation: >
  Implement a mandatory configuration review process for production
  deployments. Create environment-specific configuration profiles that
  enforce production security requirements. Use configuration validation
  that fails deployment if default values are detected for security-
  critical settings. Document all configuration options with their
  security implications.
