title: Unnecessary HTTP Methods Enabled
category: server_hardening
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP servers using HTTP-based transports that accept HTTP
  methods beyond those required for MCP operation. Methods such as
  TRACE, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH may be enabled by default but
  are not needed for standard MCP communication.
risk_explanation: >
  Unnecessary HTTP methods expand the attack surface. The TRACE method
  enables cross-site tracing attacks that can steal credentials. PUT and
  DELETE methods may allow unauthorized file manipulation. OPTIONS
  responses may reveal server capabilities to attackers. Each enabled
  method is a potential entry point for HTTP-specific attacks that would
  not exist with MCP over other transports.
remediation: >
  Restrict the MCP server HTTP transport to only accept the HTTP methods
  required for MCP protocol operation, typically GET and POST.
  Explicitly disable TRACE, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, and other
  unnecessary methods. Return 405 Method Not Allowed for disabled
  methods. Configure the web server or reverse proxy to enforce method
  restrictions at the network edge.
