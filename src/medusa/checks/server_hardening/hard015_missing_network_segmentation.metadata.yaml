title: Missing Network Segmentation
category: server_hardening
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP servers deployed without network segmentation between
  client-facing interfaces and backend services. Without segmentation, a
  compromised MCP server has direct network access to databases,
  internal APIs, and other sensitive backend services.
risk_explanation: >
  Missing network segmentation means that a compromised MCP server can
  directly access all backend services on the same network. This
  eliminates the defense-in-depth benefit of network isolation and
  allows an attacker who compromises the MCP server to pivot to
  databases, internal APIs, credential stores, and other servers without
  additional network-level barriers.
remediation: >
  Deploy the MCP server in a DMZ or dedicated network segment with
  firewall rules restricting access to only required backend services on
  specific ports. Use network policies to prevent lateral movement.
  Implement service mesh or zero-trust networking for internal
  communication. Monitor network traffic between segments for anomalous
  patterns.
