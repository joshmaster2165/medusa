title: Unnecessary Services Enabled
category: server_hardening
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that expose capabilities, endpoints, or protocol
  features beyond what is required for their intended function. Each
  unnecessary service increases the attack surface and provides
  additional vectors for exploitation.
risk_explanation: >
  Every enabled service or capability is a potential attack vector.
  Unnecessary MCP capabilities such as unused tool handlers, resource
  endpoints, or prompt definitions provide attackers with additional
  entry points to probe for vulnerabilities. Services that are enabled
  but not actively maintained are especially dangerous as they may
  contain unpatched security issues.
remediation: >
  Audit all enabled MCP server capabilities and disable any that are not
  required for the server intended function. Remove unused tool
  definitions, resource handlers, and prompt endpoints. Apply the
  principle of least functionality by only enabling the minimum set of
  capabilities needed. Regularly review enabled services against actual
  usage patterns.
