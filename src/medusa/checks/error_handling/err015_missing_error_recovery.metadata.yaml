title: Missing Error Recovery
category: error_handling
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server implementations that lack automatic error recovery
  mechanisms such as retry logic, connection re-establishment, or state
  rollback after transient failures. Missing recovery causes persistent
  failures from temporary issues.
risk_explanation: >
  Without automatic error recovery, transient failures such as network
  timeouts, temporary resource unavailability, or brief service
  interruptions cause permanent tool failures until manual intervention.
  Attackers can exploit this by causing brief disruptions that
  permanently degrade server functionality. State inconsistencies from
  unrecovered errors may also create security vulnerabilities.
remediation: >
  Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
  in tool operations. Add connection pool recovery for database and
  network connections. Implement transaction rollback on failure to
  maintain state consistency. Use health checks to detect and recover
  from degraded states automatically.
