title: Verbose Error Messages
category: error_handling
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server error responses that include overly detailed
  messages revealing internal implementation specifics such as database
  table names, query structures, internal API endpoints, configuration
  values, or third-party service identifiers.
risk_explanation: >
  Verbose error messages provide attackers with a roadmap of the server
  internals. Database table names enable SQL injection targeting,
  internal API paths enable SSRF attacks, and configuration details may
  reveal security misconfigurations. This information reduces the effort
  required for a successful attack significantly.
remediation: >
  Implement an error mapping layer that translates internal errors into
  generic, user-facing messages with unique error codes. Store detailed
  error information in server-side logs only. Review all error response
  templates to ensure no internal details leak to clients.
