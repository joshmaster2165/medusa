title: Sensitive File Paths in Errors
category: error_handling
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server error messages that include absolute file paths,
  revealing the server installation directory, configuration file
  locations, temporary file paths, or source code directory structure on
  the host system.
risk_explanation: >
  Exposed file paths reveal the server deployment layout, operating
  system type, user account names embedded in home directory paths, and
  the locations of sensitive files such as configuration and credential
  stores. Attackers use this information to target path traversal
  attacks, locate configuration files for extraction, and identify
  writable directories for payload placement.
remediation: >
  Configure the server runtime to strip absolute file paths from all
  error messages. Use relative paths or symbolic identifiers in error
  messages where file references are necessary. Implement an error
  sanitization filter that detects and removes path patterns from
  outgoing error responses.
