title: Missing Error Rate Alerting
category: error_handling
severity: low
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that lack monitoring and alerting for
  elevated error rates. Without error rate tracking, attacks that
  trigger errors such as brute force, fuzzing, or denial of service go
  undetected until major damage occurs.
risk_explanation: >
  Elevated error rates are often the first signal of an active attack.
  Without alerting, brute-force authentication attempts, input fuzzing
  campaigns, and resource exhaustion attacks proceed undetected. By the
  time the impact is noticed, the attacker may have already achieved
  their objective or moved laterally.
remediation: >
  Implement error rate monitoring with configurable thresholds and
  alerting for the MCP server. Track error rates by category, tool, and
  client. Set up alerts for sudden error rate spikes that may indicate
  attacks. Integrate error monitoring with the security incident
  response workflow.
