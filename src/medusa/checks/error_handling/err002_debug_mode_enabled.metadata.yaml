check_id: err002
title: Debug Mode Enabled
category: error_handling
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP servers running with debug or development mode flags
  enabled in production environments. Debug mode typically disables
  security controls, enables verbose logging, exposes diagnostic
  endpoints, and may auto-reload code on changes.
risk_explanation: >
  Debug mode often disables authentication, enables detailed error pages
  with interactive debuggers, exposes environment variables, and
  provides code execution capabilities through debug consoles. An
  attacker who discovers a debug-mode server can achieve full remote
  code execution or extract secrets with minimal effort.
remediation: >
  Ensure all MCP servers are deployed with debug and development mode
  flags explicitly set to false or removed entirely. Use environment
  variable checks to enforce production mode. Implement CI/CD checks
  that fail deployments containing debug configuration flags.
