title: Missing Error Codes
category: error_handling
severity: low
description: >
  Detects MCP server error responses that lack standardized error codes,
  relying solely on free-text error messages. Without consistent error
  codes, clients cannot programmatically handle different error
  conditions or implement proper retry logic.
risk_explanation: >
  Missing error codes force LLM clients to parse free-text error
  messages, which is unreliable and may lead to incorrect error handling
  decisions. Clients may retry non-retryable errors, ignore critical
  failures, or misinterpret error severity. This can result in data
  loss, infinite retry loops, or silent security failures.
remediation: >
  Define a standardized error code taxonomy for the MCP server that
  covers authentication errors, authorization errors, validation errors,
  rate limiting, and internal errors. Return a machine-readable error
  code alongside every error message. Document the error codes and their
  meanings for client developers.
