title: Missing Graceful Degradation
category: error_handling
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that fail completely when dependent services
  become unavailable rather than degrading gracefully. Missing
  degradation strategies mean a single service failure can cascade into
  total MCP server unavailability.
risk_explanation: >
  Without graceful degradation, an attacker can take down the entire MCP
  server by disrupting a single dependency. Cascading failures amplify
  denial-of-service attacks and may leave the system in an inconsistent
  state. Tools that depend on failed services may return corrupted or
  partial data without indicating the failure.
remediation: >
  Implement circuit breaker patterns for all external service calls.
  Design tools to operate in degraded mode when dependencies are
  unavailable, returning partial results with clear status indicators.
  Use timeouts and fallback responses for non-critical dependencies.
  Monitor dependency health and alert on degraded operation.
