title: Unhandled Exception Risk
category: error_handling
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server implementations that lack a top-level catch-all
  exception handler at the transport boundary. Without a global
  exception handler, unexpected errors can crash the server process or
  leak raw exception details to clients.
risk_explanation: >
  Unhandled exceptions at the transport boundary cause the MCP server to
  either crash entirely or return raw language-specific exception
  objects to clients. Server crashes enable denial-of-service attacks,
  while leaked exception objects reveal implementation details. Both
  outcomes are exploitable by an attacker sending malformed requests.
remediation: >
  Implement a global exception handler at the MCP transport boundary
  that catches all unhandled exceptions, logs them with full context
  server-side, and returns a generic error response to the client. Use
  process supervisors to restart crashed servers automatically. Monitor
  for elevated unhandled exception rates.
