title: Information Disclosure via Errors
category: error_handling
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server error responses that disclose system-level
  information such as operating system details, hostname, IP addresses,
  user account names, installed software versions, or runtime
  environment configuration.
risk_explanation: >
  System information disclosed through errors enables attackers to
  fingerprint the server environment, identify vulnerable software
  versions, determine network topology, and craft OS-specific exploits.
  Hostnames and IP addresses can reveal internal network structure and
  enable lateral movement planning.
remediation: >
  Sanitize all error responses to remove system-level information before
  returning them to clients. Configure the MCP server runtime to
  suppress system details in error messages. Implement an error response
  middleware that strips hostnames, paths, IPs, and version strings from
  all outgoing error payloads.
