title: API Version in Error Messages
category: error_handling
severity: low
description: >
  Detects MCP server error messages that include API version numbers,
  protocol version identifiers, or internal build version strings.
  Version information helps attackers identify specific software
  releases and their known vulnerabilities.
risk_explanation: >
  Version information in error messages allows attackers to precisely
  identify the software version running on the server and cross-
  reference it against public vulnerability databases. This targeted
  approach is more efficient than blind exploitation and increases the
  success rate of attacks against known CVEs.
remediation: >
  Remove version strings from all error response messages and headers.
  If version information must be communicated, use the MCP protocol
  negotiation phase rather than error messages. Implement build
  processes that strip version identifiers from production error message
  templates.
