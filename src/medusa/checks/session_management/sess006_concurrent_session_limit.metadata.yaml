title: Missing Concurrent Session Limit
category: session_management
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server configurations that allow unlimited concurrent
  sessions for a single user or identity. Without concurrent session
  limits, a compromised credential can be used to establish multiple
  parallel sessions across different LLM clients without the legitimate
  user being aware.
risk_explanation: >
  Without concurrent session limits, an attacker who obtains valid
  credentials can open additional MCP sessions alongside the legitimate
  user's session. This enables silent, parallel exploitation of tools
  and resources while the legitimate user continues operating normally,
  making detection difficult. It also creates resource exhaustion risks
  on the MCP server.
remediation: >
  Enforce a maximum number of concurrent sessions per user identity on
  the MCP server. Implement a policy for handling session limit
  violations, such as terminating the oldest session or rejecting new
  session requests. Notify users when concurrent session limits are
  reached or when sessions are created from new locations. Log all
  session creation events for audit.
