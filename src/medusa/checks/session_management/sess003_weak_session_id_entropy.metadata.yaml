title: Weak Session ID Entropy
category: session_management
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server session identifiers generated with insufficient
  randomness or entropy. Weak session IDs that use predictable patterns,
  sequential numbers, or low-entropy random sources can be guessed or
  brute-forced by attackers to hijack active LLM client connections.
risk_explanation: >
  Session IDs with weak entropy can be predicted or brute-forced,
  allowing an attacker to hijack active MCP sessions. This grants
  unauthorized access to all tools and resources available in the
  compromised session, enabling data exfiltration, tool misuse, and
  privilege escalation through the connected LLM client.
remediation: >
  Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) to
  produce session IDs with at least 128 bits of entropy. Avoid
  sequential, timestamp- based, or hash-based session ID schemes. Use
  standard session management libraries that have been audited for
  secure ID generation. Regularly test session ID randomness using
  statistical analysis tools.
