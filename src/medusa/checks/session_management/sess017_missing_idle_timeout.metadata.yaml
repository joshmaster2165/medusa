title: Missing Idle Session Timeout
category: session_management
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server sessions that lack idle timeout configuration.
  Without idle timeouts, sessions remain active even when no tool
  invocations or client interactions have occurred for extended periods.
  This leaves sessions open for exploitation during periods of user
  inactivity.
risk_explanation: >
  MCP sessions without idle timeouts remain active during extended
  periods of inactivity, creating unnecessary exposure windows. If a
  user steps away from their LLM client or loses connectivity, the
  session remains valid and can be hijacked. In enterprise environments,
  idle sessions represent unmonitored access points that accumulate over
  time, increasing the overall attack surface.
remediation: >
  Configure an idle session timeout on the MCP server that terminates
  sessions after a period of inactivity. Set the idle timeout to a value
  appropriate for your use case, typically 15-30 minutes. Implement
  server-side tracking of last activity time per session. Provide a
  warning to the LLM client before session expiry to allow the user to
  extend the session if needed.
