title: Session Data Exposure
category: session_management
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server implementations that store sensitive data directly
  in session objects or transmit session contents to the client. Session
  data may include tool invocation history, user credentials, resource
  URIs, or intermediate computation results that should not be exposed
  to the LLM client or stored in client-accessible session storage.
risk_explanation: >
  Exposed session data can reveal sensitive information about MCP tool
  invocations, user credentials, internal resource URIs, and server-side
  state. Attackers can extract this data to map internal infrastructure,
  harvest credentials, or understand tool behavior for crafting more
  sophisticated attacks. Client-side session storage is particularly
  dangerous as it persists beyond the session lifetime.
remediation: >
  Store all sensitive session data server-side in a secure session
  store. Never include credentials, internal URIs, or sensitive tool
  outputs in client-visible session data. Encrypt server-side session
  storage at rest. Minimize the data stored in sessions to only what is
  required for session management. Implement session data classification
  and enforce storage policies based on sensitivity.
