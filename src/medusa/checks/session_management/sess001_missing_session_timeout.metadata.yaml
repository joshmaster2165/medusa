title: Missing Session Timeout
category: session_management
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server configurations that lack session timeout settings
  for client connections. When sessions between LLM clients and MCP
  servers persist indefinitely, abandoned or forgotten sessions remain
  active and exploitable. Tool invocations can continue on stale
  sessions long after the user has disengaged.
risk_explanation: >
  Without session timeouts, compromised or abandoned MCP sessions remain
  valid indefinitely. An attacker who obtains a session token can use it
  to invoke tools, access resources, and exfiltrate data without time
  pressure. This is especially dangerous in multi-tenant MCP deployments
  where long-lived sessions can bridge trust boundaries.
remediation: >
  Configure an explicit session timeout for all MCP server connections.
  Set a maximum session lifetime appropriate for your threat model,
  typically no longer than 8 hours for interactive sessions. Implement
  server-side session expiry that cannot be overridden by the client.
  Ensure expired sessions are fully invalidated and all associated
  tokens are revoked.
