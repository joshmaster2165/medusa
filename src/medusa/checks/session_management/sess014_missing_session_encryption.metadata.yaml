title: Missing Session Encryption
category: session_management
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server sessions where session data is stored or
  transmitted without encryption. Unencrypted session tokens and session
  state can be intercepted in transit or read from storage by attackers
  with access to network traffic or the storage medium.
risk_explanation: >
  Unencrypted MCP session data is vulnerable to interception during
  transit and unauthorized access at rest. Attackers on the same network
  can capture session tokens via packet sniffing. Attackers with storage
  access can read session state including tool invocation history,
  cached credentials, and intermediate results. This enables session
  hijacking and data exfiltration.
remediation: >
  Encrypt all MCP session data both in transit and at rest. Use TLS 1.2
  or higher for all session-bearing communications. Encrypt server-side
  session stores using AES-256 or equivalent. Ensure session tokens
  transmitted via cookies have the Secure flag set. For session data
  stored in databases or caches, use transparent data encryption or
  application-level encryption.
