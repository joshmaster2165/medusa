title: Missing Session ID Rotation
category: session_management
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that do not periodically rotate session
  identifiers during active sessions. Without rotation, a session ID
  remains static for the entire session lifetime, giving attackers an
  extended window to capture and exploit the token for unauthorized tool
  invocations.
risk_explanation: >
  Static session IDs that persist for the entire session lifetime
  provide attackers with a long window for capture and exploitation. If
  a session ID is leaked at any point during a long-running MCP session,
  the attacker can use it for the remainder of the session. In MCP
  contexts where sessions may last hours during extended LLM
  interactions, this risk is amplified.
remediation: >
  Implement periodic session ID rotation during active MCP sessions.
  Rotate the session ID at least every 15-30 minutes and immediately
  after any privilege level change. Ensure the old session ID is
  invalidated upon rotation. Maintain session continuity across rotation
  by migrating session state to the new ID atomically. Log all rotation
  events for audit purposes.
