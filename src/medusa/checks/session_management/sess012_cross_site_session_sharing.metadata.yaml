title: Cross-Site Session Sharing
category: session_management
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server configurations where session tokens can be shared
  or reused across different origins, domains, or MCP server instances.
  Cross-site session sharing violates the principle of session isolation
  and allows a compromised server to leverage sessions established with
  a different server.
risk_explanation: >
  When MCP session tokens are valid across multiple origins or servers,
  a compromise of any single server grants access to all servers sharing
  the session. This dramatically increases the blast radius of a
  security incident. A malicious MCP server could capture session tokens
  and replay them against legitimate servers, gaining unauthorized
  access to tools and resources.
remediation: >
  Ensure MCP session tokens are scoped to a single server origin and
  cannot be reused across different MCP server instances. Include the
  server identity in session token validation. Use audience-restricted
  tokens that are bound to a specific MCP server endpoint. Implement
  session isolation at the transport layer using distinct cookie domains
  or authorization scopes per server.
