title: Missing Session Audit Trail
category: session_management
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments that do not maintain an audit trail of
  session lifecycle events including creation, authentication, tool
  invocations, privilege changes, and termination. Without session
  auditing, security incidents involving compromised sessions cannot be
  investigated or detected.
risk_explanation: >
  Without session audit trails, organizations cannot detect session
  hijacking, investigate security incidents, or demonstrate compliance
  with regulatory requirements. When an MCP session is compromised, the
  lack of audit data makes it impossible to determine what tools were
  invoked, what data was accessed, or how long the attacker maintained
  access. This hampers incident response and forensic analysis.
remediation: >
  Implement comprehensive session audit logging that records all session
  lifecycle events. Log session creation with client metadata,
  authentication events, all tool invocations with timestamps, privilege
  changes, and session termination reasons. Store audit logs in a
  tamper-resistant log store with appropriate retention periods.
  Implement real-time alerting on suspicious session activity patterns.
