title: Session Fixation Vulnerability
category: session_management
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server implementations vulnerable to session fixation
  attacks where an attacker can force a known session ID onto a victim's
  LLM client connection. If the server accepts externally supplied
  session identifiers without regeneration after authentication, an
  attacker can pre-set the session ID and then hijack the authenticated
  session.
risk_explanation: >
  Session fixation allows an attacker to establish a valid session and
  then trick a legitimate user into authenticating on that session. Once
  the victim authenticates, the attacker already possesses the session
  token and gains full access to all MCP tool invocations and resources
  available to the victim. This can lead to unauthorized data access,
  privilege escalation, and tool abuse.
remediation: >
  Always generate a new session ID on the server side after successful
  authentication. Reject any session IDs supplied by the client prior to
  authentication. Invalidate pre-authentication session tokens
  immediately upon login. Implement session ID regeneration at privilege
  level changes within the MCP server lifecycle.
