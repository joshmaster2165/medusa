title: Missing Session-IP Binding
category: session_management
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server sessions that are not bound to the originating
  client IP address or other client fingerprint. Without session
  binding, a session token stolen from one network location can be used
  from any other location to invoke tools and access resources on the
  MCP server.
risk_explanation: >
  Unbound MCP sessions can be used from any network location, meaning a
  stolen session token grants full access regardless of where the
  attacker is located. This removes a significant barrier to session
  hijacking and makes stolen tokens maximally useful to attackers. In
  MCP deployments handling sensitive tool invocations, this
  significantly increases the blast radius of token compromise.
remediation: >
  Bind MCP sessions to the client's IP address or a stable client
  fingerprint at session creation time. Invalidate sessions when the
  source IP changes unexpectedly. For environments where IP changes are
  expected (mobile users, VPNs), use additional binding factors such as
  TLS client certificate fingerprints or User-Agent strings. Log and
  alert on binding violations.
