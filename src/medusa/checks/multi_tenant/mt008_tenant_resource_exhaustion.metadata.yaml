title: Tenant Resource Exhaustion
category: multi_tenant
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that do not enforce per-tenant resource quotas,
  allowing a single tenant to monopolize shared server resources
  including CPU, memory, network bandwidth, storage, and database
  connections, causing denial of service for other tenants.
risk_explanation: >
  Without per-tenant resource limits, a single tenant can consume all
  available server resources through normal heavy usage or intentional
  abuse. This causes performance degradation or complete denial of
  service for all other tenants. In a competitive multi-tenant
  environment, a malicious tenant can deliberately exhaust resources to
  disrupt competitor tenants.
remediation: >
  Implement per-tenant resource quotas for CPU time, memory usage,
  storage space, network bandwidth, and concurrent connections. Use fair
  scheduling algorithms that prevent any single tenant from monopolizing
  shared resources. Set rate limits per tenant for API calls and tool
  invocations. Monitor per-tenant resource consumption and alert on
  abnormal usage patterns.
