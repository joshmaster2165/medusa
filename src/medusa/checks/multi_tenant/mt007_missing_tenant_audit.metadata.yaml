title: Missing Tenant-Specific Audit
category: multi_tenant
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that lack tenant-specific audit logging, making it
  impossible to track which tenant performed which operations. Without
  tenant-scoped audit trails, security incidents cannot be properly
  investigated and tenant compliance requirements are unmet.
risk_explanation: >
  Missing tenant-specific audit logs prevent forensic investigation of
  cross-tenant security incidents. When a breach occurs, it is
  impossible to determine which tenant was affected, what data was
  accessed, or which tenant initiated the malicious activity. This also
  fails compliance requirements such as GDPR, SOC 2, and HIPAA that
  mandate per-tenant audit capabilities.
remediation: >
  Implement tenant-scoped audit logging that records the tenant context
  for every operation. Store audit logs in tenant-isolated partitions to
  prevent cross-tenant log access. Include tenant identifier, operation
  type, resources accessed, and outcome in every audit record. Provide
  per-tenant audit log access for compliance reporting. Implement
  tamper-proof audit log storage.
