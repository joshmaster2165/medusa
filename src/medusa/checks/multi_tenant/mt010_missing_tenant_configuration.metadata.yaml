title: Missing Tenant Configuration Isolation
category: multi_tenant
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP servers where tenant-specific configuration such as
  security policies, feature flags, access controls, and operational
  parameters is stored in shared configuration without proper isolation.
  Configuration bleed between tenants can alter security posture
  unexpectedly.
risk_explanation: >
  Shared configuration without tenant isolation means that a
  configuration change for one tenant can inadvertently affect other
  tenants. Security policy changes, feature flag modifications, and
  access control updates for one tenant may be applied to others. An
  attacker who gains configuration access for one tenant can weaken
  security settings for all tenants on the server.
remediation: >
  Implement tenant-isolated configuration storage with independent
  configuration contexts per tenant. Validate that configuration changes
  are scoped to the requesting tenant. Use configuration inheritance
  hierarchies where tenant-specific settings override shared defaults
  without affecting other tenants. Audit all configuration changes with
  tenant context for traceability.
