title: Cross-Tenant Tool Access
category: multi_tenant
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP servers where tools registered by one tenant are
  accessible to other tenants, or where tool execution results from one
  tenant can be observed by another. Cross-tenant tool access enables
  unauthorized operations and data theft through shared tool
  infrastructure.
risk_explanation: >
  Cross-tenant tool access allows one tenant to invoke tools configured
  by another tenant, potentially using the other tenant credentials and
  permissions. This can result in unauthorized data access, financial
  transactions, or system modifications performed through another tenant
  tool configuration. Tool results leaking across tenants exposes
  operation outcomes and returned data.
remediation: >
  Implement strict tenant isolation for tool registration, discovery,
  and invocation. Ensure that each tenant can only see and invoke tools
  registered within their own tenant context. Execute tools within
  tenant-specific sandboxes that prevent cross-tenant resource access.
  Validate tenant context at tool invocation time and reject cross-
  tenant tool calls.
