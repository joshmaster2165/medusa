title: Missing Tenant Isolation
category: multi_tenant
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that handle multiple tenants without implementing
  proper isolation between tenant contexts. Missing isolation allows one
  tenant operations, data, and tool invocations to affect or be visible
  to other tenants sharing the same server instance.
risk_explanation: >
  Without tenant isolation, one tenant can access another tenant data,
  tool results, and resources. This is a catastrophic security failure
  in multi-tenant deployments where competing organizations, different
  security clearance levels, or privacy-regulated data share the same
  MCP server. A single compromised tenant account can exfiltrate all
  other tenants data.
remediation: >
  Implement strict tenant isolation at every layer of the MCP server
  including request processing, data access, tool execution, resource
  access, and response delivery. Use tenant-specific execution contexts
  that prevent cross-tenant memory access. Enforce tenant boundaries in
  all database queries and file system operations. Validate tenant
  context on every request and reject any cross-tenant access attempts.
