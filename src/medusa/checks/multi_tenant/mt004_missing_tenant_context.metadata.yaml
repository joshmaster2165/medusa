title: Missing Tenant Context Validation
category: multi_tenant
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server requests that are processed without validating the
  tenant context, or where the tenant identifier is derived from client-
  supplied data without verification. Missing tenant context validation
  allows clients to operate outside their authorized tenant scope.
risk_explanation: >
  Without tenant context validation, a client can forge or manipulate
  its tenant identifier to access another tenant context. If the tenant
  ID is taken from a request header or parameter without cryptographic
  verification, any client can impersonate any tenant by simply changing
  the value. This enables complete bypass of all tenant-based access
  controls.
remediation: >
  Derive the tenant context from authenticated session state rather than
  client-supplied parameters. Validate tenant context cryptographically
  using signed tokens or verified session data. Reject requests that
  lack valid tenant context. Implement tenant context as an immutable
  property of the authenticated session that cannot be modified by the
  client after authentication.
