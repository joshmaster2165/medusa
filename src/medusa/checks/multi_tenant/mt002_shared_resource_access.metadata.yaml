title: Shared Resource Cross-Tenant Access
category: multi_tenant
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP server resources that are accessible across tenant
  boundaries without proper access control. Shared resources such as
  files, database connections, caches, and temporary storage that lack
  tenant-scoped access controls enable cross-tenant data access.
risk_explanation: >
  Shared resources without tenant scoping create direct data leakage
  paths between tenants. A tenant can read files created by another
  tenant, access cached data from other tenant sessions, query database
  records belonging to other tenants, or read temporary files from other
  tenant operations. This violates data confidentiality and may breach
  regulatory requirements.
remediation: >
  Scope all server resources to the requesting tenant using tenant-
  specific prefixes, namespaces, or separate storage. Implement tenant
  validation on all resource access operations. Use separate database
  schemas, file directories, or cache namespaces per tenant. Audit all
  shared resources to ensure tenant isolation is enforced at the storage
  level, not just the application level.
