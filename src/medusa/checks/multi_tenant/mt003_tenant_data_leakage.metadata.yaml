title: Tenant Data Leakage
category: multi_tenant
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP server responses, error messages, logs, or metadata that
  leak data belonging to one tenant to another tenant. Data leakage can
  occur through shared error handlers, common log streams, cached
  responses, or improperly scoped query results.
risk_explanation: >
  Tenant data leakage exposes confidential business information,
  personal data, and security credentials to unauthorized tenants. Even
  small leaks such as tenant names in error messages or record counts in
  metadata can reveal business intelligence to competitors. Systematic
  leakage through query result contamination or cache poisoning can
  expose entire datasets across tenant boundaries.
remediation: >
  Audit all server output paths for potential cross-tenant data leakage.
  Implement tenant-scoped logging that prevents log data from one tenant
  being visible to another. Use separate response serialization contexts
  per tenant. Clear all shared state between tenant request processing.
  Implement automated testing that verifies tenant data isolation across
  all server operations.
