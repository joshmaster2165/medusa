title: Weak Password Policy
category: authentication
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server authentication configurations with password
  requirements below security standards. Weak password policies allow
  short, simple, or commonly used passwords that are easily guessed or
  cracked.
risk_explanation: >
  Weak passwords are the primary vector for credential-based attacks.
  Short passwords can be brute-forced quickly, common passwords appear
  in dictionary attacks, and passwords without complexity requirements
  are easily guessed. Password reuse across services amplifies the
  impact of any single breach.
remediation: >
  Enforce a minimum password length of 12 characters. Check passwords
  against known breach databases (e.g. Have I Been Pwned). Require a mix
  of character types. Implement password strength estimation using
  algorithms like zxcvbn. Support passphrase-based authentication as an
  alternative.
