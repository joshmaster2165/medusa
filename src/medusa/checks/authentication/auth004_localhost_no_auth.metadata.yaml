title: Localhost Binding Without Authentication
category: authentication
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP servers bound to localhost (127.0.0.1 or ::1) over HTTP/SSE
  without any authentication mechanism. While localhost binding limits direct
  remote access, it does not protect against DNS rebinding attacks, malicious
  browser extensions, or other local processes.
risk_explanation: >
  Localhost-bound services without authentication are vulnerable to DNS
  rebinding attacks where a malicious website tricks the user's browser into
  making requests to the local MCP server. Because the requests originate
  from the local machine, network-level restrictions are bypassed. Any local
  process or browser script can also invoke the server's tools without
  credentials.
remediation: >
  Always require authentication even for localhost-bound MCP servers. Use
  bearer tokens, API keys, or OAuth with PKCE. Additionally, implement CORS
  restrictions and validate the Host/Origin headers to mitigate DNS rebinding.
  Consider binding to a Unix domain socket instead of a TCP port when only
  local access is needed.
