title: Hardcoded Credentials in Config
category: authentication
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects username and password pairs, API keys, and other credentials
  hardcoded directly in MCP server configuration files or source code.
  Hardcoded credentials cannot be rotated without code changes and are
  trivially extracted from the codebase.
risk_explanation: >
  Hardcoded credentials are shared with anyone who has access to the
  source code or configuration files. They persist in version control
  history even after removal, are identical across all deployments, and
  cannot be rotated without a code change. A single repository leak
  exposes all instances of the service.
remediation: >
  Remove all hardcoded credentials from source code and configuration
  files. Use environment variables, secrets managers, or secure vault
  services for credential storage. Implement credential rotation
  mechanisms that do not require code changes. Scan repositories for
  credential patterns using pre-commit hooks and CI/CD secret scanners.
