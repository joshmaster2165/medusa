title: Basic Auth Over HTTP
category: authentication
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects HTTP Basic authentication used over unencrypted HTTP
  connections. Basic auth transmits credentials as base64-encoded
  plaintext, which is trivially decoded by any network observer when TLS
  is not used.
risk_explanation: >
  Basic authentication over HTTP transmits username and password in
  every request as a base64-encoded string that is equivalent to
  plaintext. Any network observer, proxy, or man-in-the-middle can
  decode the credentials instantly. Unlike token-based auth, Basic auth
  transmits the actual password, making compromise permanent until the
  password is changed.
remediation: >
  Never use HTTP Basic authentication without TLS. Switch to HTTPS for
  all endpoints using Basic auth. Preferably, migrate to token-based
  authentication (OAuth 2.1 Bearer tokens) which limits the exposure
  window. If Basic auth is required, enforce HSTS to prevent protocol
  downgrade attacks.
