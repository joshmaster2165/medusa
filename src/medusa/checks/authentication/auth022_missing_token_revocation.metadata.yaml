title: Missing Token Revocation
category: authentication
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server configurations without a mechanism to revoke
  compromised or unused tokens. Without revocation, compromised tokens
  remain valid until they expire, which may be a long time or never.
risk_explanation: >
  When a token is compromised, the inability to revoke it means the
  attacker retains access until natural expiration. For long-lived or
  non-expiring tokens, this means indefinite unauthorized access. Token
  revocation is essential for incident response and access management.
remediation: >
  Implement a token revocation endpoint that immediately invalidates
  compromised tokens. Maintain a revocation list or use short-lived
  tokens with a token introspection endpoint. Support RFC 7009 token
  revocation for OAuth-based flows. Include revocation as part of the
  incident response procedure.
