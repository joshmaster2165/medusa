title: Missing Logout Mechanism
category: authentication
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server configurations without a mechanism to invalidate
  active sessions or tokens on logout. Without logout functionality,
  users cannot terminate their sessions, leaving them vulnerable to
  session hijacking and unauthorized reuse.
risk_explanation: >
  Without a logout mechanism, sessions remain active indefinitely or
  until they expire naturally. Users cannot terminate sessions from
  compromised devices. Shared workstations retain active sessions for
  the next user. In incident response scenarios, there is no way to
  force-terminate a user's active sessions.
remediation: >
  Implement a logout endpoint that invalidates the user's session and
  associated tokens. Clear session cookies and revoke refresh tokens on
  logout. Provide a mechanism to terminate all active sessions for a
  user. Support server-side session invalidation for incident response.
