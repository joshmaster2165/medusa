title: Shared Secrets Across Servers
category: authentication
severity: high
description: >
  Detects identical credentials or API keys used across multiple MCP
  servers. Sharing secrets across servers means that a compromise of one
  server exposes all servers using the same credential.
risk_explanation: >
  When multiple MCP servers share the same authentication secret, a
  breach of any single server compromises all of them. The attacker
  gains lateral movement capability across the entire MCP
  infrastructure. Shared secrets also make it impossible to revoke
  access to a single server without affecting all others.
remediation: >
  Issue unique credentials for each MCP server. Use a secrets manager to
  generate and distribute per-server secrets. Implement credential
  rotation that can target individual servers. Audit credential usage to
  detect shared secrets across server configurations.
