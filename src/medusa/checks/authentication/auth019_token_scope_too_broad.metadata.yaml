title: Token Scope Too Broad
category: authentication
severity: high
description: >
  Detects authentication tokens with excessively broad permission scopes
  that grant access beyond what is required for the token's intended
  use. Over-scoped tokens violate the principle of least privilege and
  amplify the impact of token compromise.
risk_explanation: >
  A token with broad scopes (e.g. full admin access when only read
  access is needed) grants an attacker who compromises the token far
  more access than the legitimate use case requires. Over-scoped tokens
  are common when developers request all permissions during development
  and fail to restrict them for production.
remediation: >
  Issue tokens with the minimum scopes required for their intended use.
  Implement scope-based access control that maps each tool to its
  required permissions. Review and restrict token scopes during security
  audits. Use OAuth 2.0 scope parameters to request only necessary
  permissions.
