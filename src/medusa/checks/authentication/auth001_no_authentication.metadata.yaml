title: No Authentication on HTTP Transport
category: authentication
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP servers exposed over HTTP or SSE transports without any
  authentication mechanism configured. Unauthenticated HTTP endpoints allow
  any network-reachable client to invoke server tools, read resources, and
  exfiltrate data without proving identity.
risk_explanation: >
  An unauthenticated MCP server accepts requests from any client on the
  network. Attackers can discover the endpoint through port scanning or DNS
  rebinding and invoke arbitrary tools, access sensitive resources, or inject
  malicious prompts. This is especially dangerous when the server has access
  to databases, file systems, or third-party APIs.
remediation: >
  Configure authentication for all HTTP/SSE MCP servers. Use OAuth 2.1 with
  PKCE as recommended by the MCP specification. At minimum, require a bearer
  token or API key in the Authorization header. Never expose unauthenticated
  MCP endpoints outside localhost, and even localhost endpoints should use
  authentication to mitigate DNS rebinding attacks.
