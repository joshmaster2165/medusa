title: Missing Mutual TLS
category: authentication
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that do not require client certificate
  authentication (mutual TLS). Without mTLS, the server cannot
  cryptographically verify the identity of connecting clients, relying
  solely on application-layer credentials that may be stolen or forged.
risk_explanation: >
  Without mutual TLS, any client presenting valid application-layer
  credentials (tokens, API keys) is accepted, even if the client itself
  is not a trusted entity. Stolen credentials can be used from any
  machine. mTLS provides an additional layer of assurance that the
  connecting client possesses a valid certificate issued by a trusted
  authority.
remediation: >
  Configure mutual TLS on MCP server endpoints for high-security
  deployments. Issue client certificates from a private CA to authorized
  MCP clients. Configure the server to require and validate client
  certificates during TLS handshake. Use certificate-bound access tokens
  for additional security.
