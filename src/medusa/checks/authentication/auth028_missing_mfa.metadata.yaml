title: Missing Multi-Factor Authentication
category: authentication
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server configurations without support for multi-factor
  authentication. MFA provides an additional layer of security beyond
  passwords, significantly reducing the risk of credential-based
  attacks.
risk_explanation: >
  Single-factor authentication (password only) is vulnerable to
  phishing, credential stuffing, and brute-force attacks. Without MFA, a
  compromised password grants immediate full access to the MCP server.
  MFA adds a second verification step that prevents access even when the
  primary credential is compromised.
remediation: >
  Implement multi-factor authentication for all MCP server access,
  especially for administrative and sensitive operations. Support TOTP
  (RFC 6238) or WebAuthn/FIDO2 as second factors. Require MFA for
  initial authentication and for privilege escalation events. Provide
  backup recovery codes for MFA lockout scenarios.
