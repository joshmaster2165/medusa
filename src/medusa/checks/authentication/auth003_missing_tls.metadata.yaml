title: Missing TLS on HTTP Transport
category: authentication
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP servers using plain HTTP (unencrypted) instead of HTTPS for
  their transport URL. Without TLS, all traffic between the MCP client and
  server -- including tool invocations, resource data, authentication tokens,
  and prompt content -- is transmitted in cleartext.
risk_explanation: >
  Plaintext HTTP traffic can be intercepted by any attacker with network
  access (e.g. on the same Wi-Fi network, through a compromised router, or
  via DNS spoofing). Credentials, API keys, and sensitive data passed through
  MCP tool calls are fully exposed. Man-in-the-middle attackers can also
  modify requests and responses, injecting malicious tool definitions or
  altering tool outputs.
remediation: >
  Always use HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or later) for MCP server transport URLs.
  Configure valid TLS certificates and ensure clients validate them. If the
  server is behind a reverse proxy, terminate TLS at the proxy and ensure
  the proxy-to-server link is also secured or on a trusted network segment.
