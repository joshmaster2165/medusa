check_id: auth009
title: Bearer Token in URL Parameters
category: authentication
severity: high
description: >
  Detects authentication tokens passed via URL query string parameters
  instead of HTTP headers. Tokens in URLs are logged in server access
  logs, browser history, proxy logs, and referrer headers, creating
  multiple exposure vectors.
risk_explanation: >
  URL-embedded tokens appear in web server logs, proxy logs, browser
  history, and HTTP Referer headers sent to third-party resources. Any
  system that records or processes URLs gains access to the
  authentication token. This exposure is difficult to remediate as
  tokens may persist in logs indefinitely across multiple systems.
remediation: >
  Transmit authentication tokens exclusively in HTTP Authorization
  headers using the Bearer scheme. Never include tokens in URL query
  parameters or path segments. Configure servers to reject requests that
  include tokens in URLs. Implement token binding to prevent token
  replay from logs.
