title: Missing Token Rotation
category: authentication
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects long-lived authentication tokens without a rotation mechanism.
  Tokens that persist for extended periods without rotation increase the
  window of opportunity for attackers who have obtained a compromised
  token.
risk_explanation: >
  Without token rotation, a compromised token remains valid for its
  entire lifetime, which may be weeks, months, or indefinite. The
  attacker has extended access to the MCP server, and there is no
  automatic mechanism to invalidate the compromised credential. Long-
  lived tokens also accumulate exposure through logs and monitoring
  systems over time.
remediation: >
  Implement automatic token rotation with configurable intervals. Use
  short-lived access tokens (15-60 minutes) with refresh token rotation.
  Invalidate the previous token when a new one is issued. Implement
  sliding window expiration that extends token lifetime on active use
  while revoking idle tokens.
