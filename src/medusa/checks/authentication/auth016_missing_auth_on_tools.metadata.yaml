title: Missing Authentication on Sensitive Tools
category: authentication
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP tools that perform sensitive operations (file access,
  database queries, network requests, system commands) without requiring
  authentication. Unauthenticated access to dangerous tools allows any
  client to perform privileged operations.
risk_explanation: >
  Sensitive tools without authentication can be invoked by any client
  that can reach the MCP server. This includes unauthorized users,
  malicious scripts, and attackers who have gained network access. Tools
  that modify data, access credentials, or execute commands are
  especially dangerous without authentication gates.
remediation: >
  Require authentication for all tools that perform sensitive
  operations. Implement per-tool authorization checks that verify the
  caller has the necessary permissions. Use the MCP authorization
  framework to enforce access control at the tool level. Audit all tools
  to classify their sensitivity and assign appropriate authentication
  requirements.
