title: JWT Weak Signing Key
category: authentication
severity: high
description: >
  Detects JWT tokens signed with weak or short symmetric keys that are
  vulnerable to brute-force or dictionary attacks. Short HMAC secrets
  can be cracked offline, allowing an attacker to forge valid tokens.
risk_explanation: >
  Weak JWT signing keys can be brute-forced using tools like jwt_tool or
  hashcat. Once the signing key is recovered, the attacker can forge
  tokens with arbitrary claims, including admin privileges. Symmetric
  keys shorter than 256 bits provide insufficient security against
  modern brute-force attacks.
remediation: >
  Use signing keys with at least 256 bits of entropy for HMAC
  algorithms. Prefer asymmetric algorithms (RS256, ES256) where the
  private key never leaves the server. Generate keys using
  cryptographically secure random generators. Rotate signing keys
  periodically and implement key ID (kid) header for key management.
