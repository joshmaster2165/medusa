title: Missing Rate Limit on Auth Endpoints
category: authentication
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects authentication endpoints without rate limiting or brute-force
  protection. Endpoints that accept unlimited authentication attempts
  allow attackers to perform credential stuffing and brute-force
  attacks.
risk_explanation: >
  Without rate limiting, an attacker can attempt thousands of credential
  combinations per second against the authentication endpoint.
  Credential stuffing attacks using leaked password databases are highly
  effective against unprotected endpoints. Even strong passwords can
  eventually be brute-forced given unlimited attempts.
remediation: >
  Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints with progressive
  delays. Lock accounts temporarily after a configurable number of
  failed attempts. Use CAPTCHA or proof-of-work challenges after
  repeated failures. Monitor and alert on abnormal authentication
  attempt patterns. Consider IP-based and account-based rate limiting.
