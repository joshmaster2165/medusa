title: Missing Authorization Header
category: authentication
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP servers using HTTP transport without any Authorization
  header configuration. Servers that do not expect or validate
  Authorization headers accept all requests as authenticated, providing
  no access control.
risk_explanation: >
  Without Authorization header validation, the MCP server treats all
  incoming requests as legitimate. Any client that can reach the server
  endpoint can invoke tools and access resources. This is equivalent to
  running the server with no authentication, exposing all capabilities
  to unauthorized access.
remediation: >
  Configure the MCP server to require and validate an Authorization
  header on all requests. Implement OAuth 2.1 bearer token validation as
  recommended by the MCP specification. Reject requests that do not
  include a valid Authorization header with a 401 Unauthorized response.
