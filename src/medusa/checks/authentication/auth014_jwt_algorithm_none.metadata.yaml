title: JWT Algorithm None Attack
category: authentication
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects JWT tokens that accept the 'none' algorithm, which disables
  signature verification entirely. An attacker can forge arbitrary JWT
  tokens by setting the algorithm to 'none' and removing the signature,
  granting themselves any identity or permission claims.
risk_explanation: >
  The 'none' algorithm vulnerability allows complete JWT forgery. An
  attacker creates a token with arbitrary claims (admin roles, any user
  identity) and sets alg to 'none', bypassing all signature
  verification. This grants unrestricted access to the MCP server with
  any desired permission level.
remediation: >
  Explicitly allowlist accepted JWT algorithms on the server side. Never
  accept the 'none' algorithm in production. Use asymmetric algorithms
  (RS256, ES256) where possible. Validate the 'alg' header against the
  expected algorithm before verification. Use well-maintained JWT
  libraries that reject 'none' by default.
