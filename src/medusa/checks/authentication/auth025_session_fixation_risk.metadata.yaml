title: Session Fixation Risk
category: authentication
severity: high
description: >
  Detects session management implementations that do not regenerate
  session IDs after successful authentication. Session fixation allows
  an attacker to set a known session ID before the user authenticates,
  then hijack the session after authentication elevates its privileges.
risk_explanation: >
  An attacker who can set or predict the session ID before
  authentication gains full access to the authenticated session. The
  attacker waits for the victim to authenticate with the known session
  ID, then uses that same ID to access the MCP server as the victim.
  This bypasses all authentication mechanisms.
remediation: >
  Regenerate session IDs immediately after successful authentication.
  Invalidate the pre-authentication session ID. Use cryptographically
  random session identifiers. Bind sessions to client properties (IP
  address, user agent) for additional validation. Implement session
  timeout and idle expiration.
