title: Excessive Dependency Count
category: supply_chain
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP servers with an excessive number of transitive
  dependencies. Each additional dependency increases the attack surface
  and the likelihood of including a compromised package.
risk_explanation: >
  Every dependency in the dependency tree is a potential attack vector.
  Projects with hundreds of transitive dependencies have a statistically
  higher chance of including a compromised, vulnerable, or abandoned
  package. The complexity of large dependency trees also makes security
  auditing impractical and increases the risk of dependency confusion
  attacks.
remediation: >
  Audit the dependency tree and remove unnecessary dependencies. Prefer
  packages with minimal transitive dependencies. Consider implementing
  critical functionality directly rather than importing large libraries
  for small features. Use dependency analysis tools to identify and
  eliminate redundant or overlapping dependencies.
