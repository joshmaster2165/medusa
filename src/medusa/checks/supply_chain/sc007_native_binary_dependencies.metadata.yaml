title: Native Binary Dependencies
category: supply_chain
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server dependencies that contain prebuilt native binaries.
  Prebuilt binaries cannot be audited from source code and may contain
  hidden functionality.
risk_explanation: >
  Prebuilt native binaries in packages cannot be inspected through
  source code review. They may contain backdoors, keyloggers, or data
  exfiltration code that is invisible to standard security scanning
  tools. Binary dependencies also introduce platform-specific risks and
  complicate reproducible builds.
remediation: >
  Prefer pure-language dependencies over those requiring native
  binaries. When native dependencies are necessary, build them from
  source using verified build processes. Verify binary hashes against
  trusted sources. Use sandboxing to limit the capabilities of native
  code running within the MCP server process.
