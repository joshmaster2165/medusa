title: Known Dependency Vulnerabilities
category: supply_chain
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server dependencies with known CVEs (Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures). Dependencies with unpatched
  vulnerabilities provide attackers with documented exploitation
  techniques.
risk_explanation: >
  Known vulnerabilities in dependencies have publicly available exploit
  code and detailed technical descriptions. Attackers routinely scan for
  applications using vulnerable dependencies because exploitation
  requires minimal effort. A single unpatched dependency can provide
  remote code execution, data exfiltration, or denial of service
  capabilities.
remediation: >
  Regularly scan dependencies against vulnerability databases (NVD, OSV,
  GitHub Advisory). Implement automated dependency update workflows that
  prioritize security patches. Use tools like npm audit, pip-audit, or
  Trivy in CI pipelines. Establish a maximum acceptable time-to-patch
  for each severity level.
