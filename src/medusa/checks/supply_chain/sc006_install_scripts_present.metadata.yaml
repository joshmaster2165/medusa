title: Install Scripts Present
category: supply_chain
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server dependencies that include install scripts
  (preinstall, postinstall, or equivalent lifecycle hooks). Install
  scripts execute arbitrary code during package installation.
risk_explanation: >
  Package install scripts execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
  the installing user during the npm install, pip install, or equivalent
  process. A compromised package with a malicious install script
  achieves code execution before the application even starts. Install
  scripts run outside the application's security sandbox and can access
  the full filesystem, network, and environment.
remediation: >
  Audit all packages with install scripts and verify their necessity.
  Use the --ignore-scripts flag during installation and run required
  scripts explicitly after review. Configure package managers to block
  install scripts by default. Use tools that detect and flag packages
  with install scripts during dependency review.
