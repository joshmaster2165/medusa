title: Abandoned Dependencies
category: supply_chain
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server dependencies that have not been maintained for an
  extended period. Abandoned packages no longer receive security patches
  and may contain unaddressed vulnerabilities.
risk_explanation: >
  Dependencies that are no longer actively maintained do not receive
  security patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities. As the software
  ecosystem evolves, unmaintained packages become increasingly
  vulnerable and incompatible. Depending on abandoned packages creates a
  ticking time bomb where future vulnerabilities will never be patched.
remediation: >
  Audit dependencies for maintenance status regularly. Replace abandoned
  packages with actively maintained alternatives. Monitor package
  repositories for maintenance indicators such as last commit date, open
  issue count, and release frequency. Set thresholds for acceptable
  maintenance activity (e.g. no updates in 12 months triggers review).
