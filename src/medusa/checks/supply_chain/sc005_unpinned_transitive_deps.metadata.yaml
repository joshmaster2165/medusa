title: Unpinned Transitive Dependencies
category: supply_chain
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server dependency configurations where transitive
  dependencies are not version-constrained. Unpinned transitive
  dependencies can silently update to malicious versions.
risk_explanation: >
  When transitive dependencies lack version constraints, package
  managers resolve them to the latest available version at install time.
  An attacker who publishes a malicious version of a transitive
  dependency can have their code installed silently without any change
  to the MCP server's direct dependency specifications. This is a common
  supply- chain attack vector.
remediation: >
  Use lockfiles to pin all transitive dependencies to specific versions.
  Enable hash verification for installed packages (e.g. pip --require-
  hashes, npm integrity checks). Review transitive dependency updates
  explicitly. Consider using tools that flatten and pin the entire
  dependency tree.
