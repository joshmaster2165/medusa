title: Single Maintainer Risk
category: supply_chain
severity: low
description: >
  Detects critical MCP server dependencies maintained by a single
  person. Single-maintainer packages are vulnerable to account takeover,
  maintainer burnout, and social engineering attacks.
risk_explanation: >
  Packages maintained by a single individual represent a single point of
  failure. If the maintainer's account is compromised through phishing
  or credential theft, the attacker can publish malicious updates to all
  downstream consumers. Single maintainers are also more susceptible to
  social engineering and may abandon the package without notice,
  creating an orphaned dependency.
remediation: >
  Identify critical dependencies with single maintainers and assess
  alternatives with broader maintenance teams. For essential single-
  maintainer packages, consider forking and maintaining internally,
  sponsoring additional maintainers, or contributing to the package to
  establish co-maintainer access. Monitor maintainer changes on critical
  packages for signs of account takeover.
