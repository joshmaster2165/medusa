title: Missing Timeout Configuration
category: rate_limiting
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server tools that execute without configured timeouts.
  Missing timeouts allow tool invocations to run indefinitely, consuming
  server resources and blocking processing capacity for other requests.
  Long-running tools can be intentionally triggered as a denial-of-
  service technique.
risk_explanation: >
  Tool invocations without timeouts can run indefinitely, tying up
  server threads, connections, and processing capacity. An attacker can
  intentionally trigger long-running operations such as complex queries,
  large file processing, or requests to slow external services to
  consume all available server capacity. Accumulated long-running
  requests progressively degrade performance until the server becomes
  completely unresponsive.
remediation: >
  Configure explicit execution timeouts for all MCP tool invocations.
  Set default timeouts appropriate for each tool's expected execution
  time, typically 30-60 seconds for synchronous operations. Implement
  timeout enforcement at the process level to ensure runaway tools are
  terminated. Provide timeout override configuration for tools that
  legitimately require longer execution. Log timeout events for
  monitoring and capacity planning.
