title: Missing Request Throttling
category: rate_limiting
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server API endpoints that lack request throttling
  mechanisms. Without throttling, burst traffic from LLM agents can
  saturate server capacity, degrading performance for all connected
  clients and potentially causing service outages.
risk_explanation: >
  Unthrottled MCP API endpoints are vulnerable to burst traffic that
  exceeds server capacity. LLM agents can generate rapid bursts of
  requests during multi-step operations, and without throttling, these
  bursts consume all available server resources. This degrades response
  times for all users, can trigger cascade failures in dependent
  services, and may cause the MCP server to become completely
  unresponsive.
remediation: >
  Implement request throttling that limits the rate of incoming requests
  per client. Use adaptive throttling that adjusts limits based on
  current server load. Implement queue-based request processing that
  absorbs bursts without rejecting requests immediately. Return HTTP 429
  responses with Retry-After headers when throttle limits are exceeded.
  Monitor server load metrics and adjust throttle thresholds
  dynamically.
