title: Missing Rate Limiting
category: rate_limiting
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server configurations that lack rate limiting on tool
  invocations. Without rate limits, an attacker or compromised LLM agent
  can invoke tools at an unlimited rate, overwhelming the server and any
  downstream services the tools interact with.
risk_explanation: >
  Missing rate limiting on MCP tool invocations allows attackers to
  flood the server with requests, causing denial of service for all
  users. High-frequency tool invocations can exhaust server resources,
  overwhelm downstream APIs and databases, trigger billing overages on
  metered services, and create cascading failures across the
  infrastructure. Automated agents can generate thousands of requests
  per minute without rate controls.
remediation: >
  Implement rate limiting on all MCP tool invocations using a sliding
  window or token bucket algorithm. Set per-user, per-session, and per-
  tool rate limits based on expected usage patterns. Return appropriate
  rate limit exceeded errors that allow the client to implement backoff.
  Deploy rate limiting at the server edge to protect against volumetric
  attacks. Monitor rate limit hits for anomaly detection.
