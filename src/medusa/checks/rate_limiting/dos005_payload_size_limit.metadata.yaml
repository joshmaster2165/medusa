title: Missing Payload Size Limit
category: rate_limiting
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server configurations that do not enforce size limits on
  request and response payloads. Without size limits, attackers can send
  oversized requests that consume memory during parsing or trigger tools
  to generate massive responses that exhaust server resources.
risk_explanation: >
  Missing payload size limits expose MCP servers to memory exhaustion
  attacks. An attacker can send tool invocation requests with extremely
  large parameters that consume excessive memory during parsing and
  processing. Conversely, tool invocations can be crafted to generate
  oversized responses that exhaust server memory during serialization.
  Large payloads also consume network bandwidth and can degrade
  performance for all connected clients.
remediation: >
  Enforce maximum payload size limits for all MCP requests and
  responses. Set request body size limits at the transport layer (web
  server or reverse proxy) to prevent oversized requests from reaching
  the application. Implement per-parameter size limits for tool
  invocation arguments. Set maximum response sizes for tool outputs.
  Implement streaming for large responses rather than buffering entire
  payloads in memory.
