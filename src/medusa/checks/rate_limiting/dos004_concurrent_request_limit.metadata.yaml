title: Missing Concurrent Request Limit
category: rate_limiting
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server configurations that allow unlimited concurrent
  requests from a single client or across all clients. Without
  concurrent request limits, server threads, connections, and processing
  capacity can be exhausted by parallel requests from aggressive LLM
  agents.
risk_explanation: >
  Unlimited concurrent requests allow a single LLM agent to consume all
  available server processing capacity. Modern LLM agents often issue
  multiple tool invocations in parallel, and without concurrency limits,
  a single session can monopolize server resources. An attacker can
  amplify this by opening multiple sessions, each generating parallel
  requests, creating a distributed denial-of-service condition from a
  single client.
remediation: >
  Implement concurrent request limits per client session and globally
  across the MCP server. Set a maximum number of in-flight requests per
  session based on expected agent behavior, typically 3-10 concurrent
  requests. Queue excess requests rather than rejecting them
  immediately. Monitor concurrent request counts and alert when limits
  are consistently reached. Implement fair scheduling that prevents any
  single session from monopolizing server capacity.
