title: CPU Exhaustion Risk
category: rate_limiting
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server tools that can cause excessive CPU usage through
  computationally intensive operations such as complex regex evaluation,
  cryptographic operations, data transformation, or algorithmic
  processing without CPU time limits.
risk_explanation: >
  CPU-intensive MCP tool invocations degrade performance for all
  sessions sharing the server. An attacker can trigger worst-case
  computational complexity through crafted inputs such as regex patterns
  causing catastrophic backtracking, deeply nested JSON structures, or
  large matrix operations. Unlike memory exhaustion which is immediately
  fatal, CPU exhaustion causes progressive degradation, making detection
  more difficult while still rendering the server effectively unusable
  for all clients.
remediation: >
  Implement CPU time limits for individual tool invocations using
  process-level resource controls. Use algorithms with predictable
  complexity and avoid operations vulnerable to algorithmic complexity
  attacks. Implement input validation that rejects inputs likely to
  trigger worst-case performance. Deploy CPU usage monitoring and
  alerting. Use process priority or cgroup controls to ensure tool
  invocations cannot starve the core server process.
