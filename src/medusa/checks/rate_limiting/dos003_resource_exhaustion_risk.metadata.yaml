title: Resource Exhaustion Risk
category: rate_limiting
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server tools that can consume unbounded system resources
  during execution. Tools that process large inputs, perform complex
  computations, or interact with external services without resource
  limits can exhaust server capacity and affect all connected sessions.
risk_explanation: >
  MCP tools without resource boundaries can consume unlimited CPU,
  memory, network bandwidth, or disk I/O during a single invocation. An
  attacker can craft tool inputs that trigger worst-case resource
  consumption, such as regex patterns causing catastrophic backtracking,
  queries returning massive result sets, or computations with
  exponential complexity. A single resource- exhausting tool invocation
  can render the entire MCP server unresponsive.
remediation: >
  Implement resource limits for each tool invocation including CPU time,
  memory allocation, output size, and execution duration. Use process
  isolation, containers, or sandboxes to enforce resource limits at the
  operating system level. Set timeouts for all tool executions that
  terminate runaway processes. Monitor resource consumption per tool
  invocation and alert on anomalous usage. Implement input size
  validation to prevent resource-intensive processing.
