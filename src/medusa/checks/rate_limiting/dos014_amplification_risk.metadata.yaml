title: Amplification Attack Risk
category: rate_limiting
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server tools where small input requests generate
  disproportionately large responses or trigger extensive downstream
  processing. Amplification allows an attacker to consume server and
  network resources far exceeding the cost of their requests.
risk_explanation: >
  Amplification attacks exploit MCP tools where a small input produces a
  large output or triggers extensive processing. For example, a tool
  that accepts a single database query and returns millions of rows, or
  a search tool that fans out across many services. The amplification
  ratio determines the attacker's leverage: a 1000x amplification means
  each kilobyte of attacker input consumes a megabyte of server
  resources. This makes denial of service achievable with minimal
  attacker bandwidth.
remediation: >
  Identify and mitigate amplification vectors in MCP tools. Implement
  output size limits and pagination for tools that can generate large
  responses. Set maximum result counts for search and query operations.
  Implement fan-out limits for tools that distribute requests across
  multiple services. Monitor the input-to-output ratio of tool
  invocations and alert on high amplification patterns. Apply rate
  limiting based on response size rather than just request count.
