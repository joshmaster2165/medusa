title: Memory Exhaustion Risk
category: rate_limiting
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server tools that can cause memory exhaustion through
  processing large datasets, accumulating results in memory, or
  triggering memory leaks. Memory exhaustion crashes the server process
  and terminates all active sessions.
risk_explanation: >
  Memory exhaustion in MCP servers is catastrophic because it crashes
  the server process, terminating all active sessions simultaneously. An
  attacker can trigger memory exhaustion through tools that load large
  files into memory, accumulate unbounded result sets, process data with
  memory-intensive algorithms, or exploit memory leaks through repeated
  invocations. Unlike CPU exhaustion which causes degradation, memory
  exhaustion causes immediate and complete service failure.
remediation: >
  Implement memory limits for tool invocations using process isolation
  or container memory limits. Use streaming processing for large
  datasets rather than loading entire datasets into memory. Implement
  pagination for result sets and enforce maximum result sizes. Monitor
  server memory usage and implement graceful degradation when memory
  pressure increases. Deploy automatic scaling that adds capacity before
  memory limits are reached.
