title: Slowloris Attack Risk
category: rate_limiting
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP server configurations vulnerable to slowloris-style
  attacks where clients send requests extremely slowly, holding
  connections open for extended periods. Slow connections consume server
  connection slots without generating meaningful load, exhausting the
  server's ability to accept new connections.
risk_explanation: >
  Slowloris attacks are particularly effective against MCP servers
  because they require minimal attacker resources while consuming
  maximum server resources. By sending HTTP headers or WebSocket frames
  one byte at a time, an attacker can hold hundreds of connections open
  simultaneously, each consuming a server connection slot. This prevents
  legitimate LLM clients from connecting to the server, creating a
  denial of service without generating suspicious traffic volumes.
remediation: >
  Configure minimum request rate thresholds that close connections not
  making sufficient progress. Set request header and body read timeouts
  that terminate slow connections. Deploy a reverse proxy or load
  balancer that buffers incoming requests and only forwards complete
  requests to the MCP server. Implement connection limits per IP
  address. Use async I/O server implementations that handle slow
  connections efficiently without blocking threads.
