title: Server Version Spoofing
category: server_identity
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that report a version number that does not match
  their actual binary or package version. Version spoofing can hide
  known vulnerabilities or bypass version-based security policies.
risk_explanation: >
  A server that reports a false version number can bypass version-based
  security checks and compatibility requirements. An outdated server
  with known vulnerabilities can report a newer version to avoid
  security scanning. Conversely, a malicious server can report an older
  version to exploit client-side compatibility shims that relax security
  controls for legacy servers.
remediation: >
  Implement server version verification by cross-referencing the
  reported version against the binary hash or package metadata. Use
  integrity checks that verify the server binary matches the reported
  version. Alert when version mismatches are detected. Maintain a
  version verification database for known MCP server packages.
