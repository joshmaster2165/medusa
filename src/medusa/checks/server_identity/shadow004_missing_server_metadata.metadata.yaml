title: Missing Server Metadata
category: server_identity
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that lack descriptive metadata such as a human-
  readable description, author information, contact details, or homepage
  URL. Missing metadata makes it difficult to verify server legitimacy.
risk_explanation: >
  Servers without adequate metadata cannot be easily verified by users
  or administrators. Missing descriptions prevent users from
  understanding what a server does before granting it access. Missing
  contact information prevents reporting security issues. Missing author
  and homepage details make it impossible to verify the server's
  provenance and legitimacy.
remediation: >
  Ensure all MCP servers include comprehensive metadata: a clear
  description of functionality, author name and contact information,
  homepage or repository URL, and license information. Implement server
  registration policies that require minimum metadata fields. Display
  server metadata to users during consent and authorization flows.
