title: Suspicious Server Origin
category: server_identity
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server binaries loaded from untrusted or unusual file
  system locations. Legitimate servers should be installed in standard
  locations, not loaded from temporary directories, downloads folders,
  or user-writable system paths.
risk_explanation: >
  Server binaries loaded from untrusted locations such as /tmp,
  ~/Downloads, or world-writable directories may have been placed there
  by malware or social engineering attacks. An attacker can trick users
  into running a malicious MCP server disguised as a legitimate tool by
  placing it in an unexpected location where it gets automatically
  discovered or manually configured.
remediation: >
  Restrict MCP server binary locations to trusted installation paths.
  Implement path allowlisting in client configurations that rejects
  servers loaded from temporary, download, or world-writable
  directories. Verify server binary integrity using code signing before
  execution. Alert users when a server is loaded from an unusual
  location.
