title: Agent Resource Exhaustion
category: agentic_behavior
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP configurations where agents can consume excessive
  computational resources including CPU, memory, disk, network
  bandwidth, and API quotas through unrestricted tool invocations.
  Resource exhaustion degrades or denies service for all users of the
  MCP infrastructure.
risk_explanation: >
  Agent resource exhaustion can be triggered by prompt injection attacks
  that instruct the agent to invoke resource-intensive tools repeatedly.
  This affects not only the attacker's session but potentially all users
  sharing the MCP infrastructure. Exhaustion of API quotas can block
  legitimate operations, memory exhaustion can crash servers, and CPU
  exhaustion can degrade performance for all sessions. The agent's
  autonomy amplifies the impact because it can continuously request
  resources without human intervention.
remediation: >
  Implement resource budgets for each agent session including limits on
  CPU time, memory usage, disk space, network bandwidth, and API call
  counts. Monitor resource consumption in real time and terminate
  sessions that exceed budgets. Implement per-tool resource limits that
  prevent any single tool invocation from consuming excessive resources.
  Use isolation mechanisms such as containers or sandboxes to enforce
  resource limits at the infrastructure level.
