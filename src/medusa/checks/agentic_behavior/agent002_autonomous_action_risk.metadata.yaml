title: Autonomous Action Risk
category: agentic_behavior
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server deployments where the LLM agent can take actions in
  the real world without user approval. This includes sending network
  requests, modifying files, interacting with external APIs, or
  executing commands autonomously based solely on the LLM's
  interpretation of the user's intent.
risk_explanation: >
  Autonomous actions by LLM agents connected to MCP servers carry
  significant risk because LLMs can misinterpret instructions,
  hallucinate actions, or be manipulated through prompt injection.
  Without approval gates, a compromised agent can cause widespread
  damage across all connected tools and services before the user becomes
  aware. The autonomous nature of these actions means they can chain
  together, amplifying the impact.
remediation: >
  Implement an action approval framework that categorizes tool
  invocations by risk level and requires user approval for actions above
  a configurable threshold. Provide a preview of the planned action
  including affected resources and potential consequences. Support both
  synchronous approval (blocking until approved) and asynchronous
  notification. Allow users to configure auto-approval rules for
  trusted, low-risk operations.
