title: Multi-Agent Coordination Risk
category: agentic_behavior
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP configurations involving multiple agents that communicate
  or coordinate without adequate security controls. In multi-agent
  systems, one compromised agent can influence, manipulate, or attack
  other agents through inter-agent communication channels.
risk_explanation: >
  Multi-agent coordination introduces risks where a single compromised
  agent can propagate attacks to other agents in the system. Through
  inter-agent communication, a malicious agent can inject prompts into
  other agents' contexts, manipulate shared state, coordinate
  distributed attacks, and create a network of compromised agents. The
  trust relationships between agents amplify the impact because agents
  may accept instructions from peers without the same scrutiny applied
  to external inputs.
remediation: >
  Implement authentication and authorization for all inter-agent
  communication. Apply the same security scrutiny to messages from other
  agents as to external inputs. Use message signing to verify the
  identity and integrity of inter-agent messages. Implement isolation
  between agents that prevents one agent from accessing another's
  context or tools. Monitor inter-agent communication for anomalous
  patterns. Limit the scope of actions agents can request from each
  other.
