title: Agent Data Hoarding
category: agentic_behavior
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP configurations where agents collect, store, or retain more
  data than necessary for their current task. Data hoarding increases
  the value of a compromised session and violates data minimization
  principles required by privacy regulations.
risk_explanation: >
  Agents that accumulate unnecessary data in their context create a
  high-value target for attackers. If the agent's context contains
  credentials, PII, financial data, or proprietary information from
  previous tool invocations, a single prompt injection attack can
  exfiltrate all of this accumulated data. Data hoarding also creates
  privacy compliance risks as the agent retains personal information
  beyond the minimum required for task completion.
remediation: >
  Implement data minimization policies that limit the information
  retained in the agent's context. Clear tool outputs from the context
  after they have been processed and are no longer needed. Apply data
  classification to tool outputs and enforce retention limits based on
  sensitivity. Implement context pruning that removes sensitive data
  after use. Provide users with visibility into what data the agent is
  retaining.
