title: Goal Hijacking
category: agentic_behavior
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP configurations where the agent's primary goal or task can
  be redirected through prompt injection in tool outputs, resource
  contents, or sampling responses. Goal hijacking causes the agent to
  abandon the user's intended task and pursue an attacker-defined
  objective.
risk_explanation: >
  Goal hijacking is one of the most impactful agentic attacks because it
  redirects the agent's entire action sequence toward attacker-defined
  objectives. Once hijacked, the agent uses all of its available tools
  and resources to accomplish the attacker's goal rather than the
  user's. The agent may exfiltrate data, modify systems, or take
  destructive actions while appearing to operate normally. Users may not
  notice the hijacking until significant damage has occurred.
remediation: >
  Implement goal tracking that monitors the agent's actions for
  consistency with the user's stated objective. Detect abrupt changes in
  action patterns that suggest goal hijacking. Require periodic user
  confirmation that the agent is on the correct task. Apply instruction
  hierarchy that prioritizes user instructions over tool-provided
  instructions. Implement guardrails that prevent the agent from taking
  actions unrelated to the stated goal.
