title: Capability Accumulation
category: agentic_behavior
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP configurations where an agent gradually accumulates
  permissions, tool access, or resource privileges over the course of a
  session or across sessions. Capability accumulation violates the
  principle of least privilege by granting the agent more access than
  needed for any single task.
risk_explanation: >
  Capability accumulation creates a growing attack surface as the agent
  gains access to more tools, resources, and permissions over time. Each
  new capability increases the potential damage from a compromise. A
  prompt injection attack is more damaging when the agent has
  accumulated access to file systems, databases, external APIs, and
  administrative tools than when it has access to only the tools needed
  for the current task. Accumulated capabilities also increase the value
  of session hijacking.
remediation: >
  Implement dynamic capability management that grants tools and
  permissions only for the current task and revokes them when the task
  is complete. Apply the principle of least privilege by starting each
  interaction with minimal capabilities. Require explicit user approval
  for capability grants that exceed the current task scope. Track and
  display the agent's current capability set to the user. Implement
  capability expiration timers.
