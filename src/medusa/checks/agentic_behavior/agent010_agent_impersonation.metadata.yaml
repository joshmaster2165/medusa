title: Agent Impersonation
category: agentic_behavior
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP configurations where one agent or MCP server can
  impersonate another agent's identity or claim to be a trusted system
  component. Impersonation allows a malicious entity to inherit the
  trust level and permissions of the impersonated agent, bypassing
  access controls.
risk_explanation: >
  Agent impersonation in MCP systems allows a malicious server to
  present itself as a trusted agent, inheriting permissions and trust
  relationships that were not legitimately granted. In multi-agent
  architectures, this enables unauthorized access to tools, resources,
  and data that are reserved for the impersonated agent. Users cannot
  distinguish between the legitimate agent and the impostor, making this
  attack difficult to detect.
remediation: >
  Implement cryptographic identity verification for all agents in the
  MCP system. Use mutual TLS or signed identity tokens to authenticate
  agent identities. Prevent MCP servers from claiming arbitrary agent
  identities. Verify agent identity at each interaction point rather
  than relying on initial authentication. Implement identity attestation
  that is verified by the LLM client before granting access.
