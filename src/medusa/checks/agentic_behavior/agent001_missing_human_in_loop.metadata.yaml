title: Missing Human-in-the-Loop
category: agentic_behavior
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP server configurations where destructive or irreversible
  tool invocations can be executed without requiring explicit user
  confirmation. Actions such as file deletion, database modification,
  sending emails, or executing system commands should require a human
  approval step before proceeding.
risk_explanation: >
  Without human-in-the-loop controls, an LLM agent connected to MCP
  servers can autonomously execute destructive actions based on
  misunderstood instructions, prompt injection, or model hallucination.
  A single erroneous tool invocation can delete data, send unauthorized
  communications, modify production systems, or commit financial
  transactions without the user's knowledge or consent. The speed of
  autonomous execution prevents timely intervention.
remediation: >
  Implement a confirmation mechanism that requires explicit user
  approval for destructive or high-impact tool invocations. Categorize
  tools by risk level and require confirmation for medium and high-risk
  operations. Display the full tool invocation details including
  parameters and expected effects before requesting approval. Implement
  a timeout for approval requests that defaults to denial if not
  answered.
