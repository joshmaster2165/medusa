title: Reward Hacking
category: agentic_behavior
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP configurations where an attacker can exploit the agent's
  reward or feedback mechanisms to reinforce undesired behavior. By
  manipulating success signals, error messages, or feedback loops, an
  attacker can train the agent to prefer malicious tools or follow
  harmful patterns.
risk_explanation: >
  Reward hacking exploits the agent's learning and adaptation
  mechanisms. In MCP systems where agents adjust behavior based on
  success or failure signals from tools, an attacker can manipulate
  these signals to reinforce malicious behavior. A compromised tool
  might return success indicators for harmful actions and failure
  indicators for legitimate ones, gradually training the agent to prefer
  the attacker's desired behavior patterns.
remediation: >
  Implement independent success verification that does not rely solely
  on tool responses. Use multi-signal validation where tool success is
  confirmed through independent channels. Apply anomaly detection to
  feedback patterns that may indicate reward manipulation. Limit the
  agent's ability to modify its own behavior based on tool feedback. Log
  all feedback signals for analysis and audit.
