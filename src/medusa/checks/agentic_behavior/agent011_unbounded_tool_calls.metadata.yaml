title: Unbounded Tool Call Count
category: agentic_behavior
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP configurations that do not limit the number of tool
  invocations an agent can make within a single conversation turn or
  session. Without bounds, an agent can make an unlimited number of tool
  calls, consuming resources and potentially causing cumulative harm
  through repeated actions.
risk_explanation: >
  Unbounded tool call counts allow an agent to execute an arbitrary
  number of operations in a single turn, leading to resource exhaustion,
  excessive costs, and potential cumulative harm. A prompt injection
  attack can instruct the agent to invoke tools hundreds or thousands of
  times, each invocation potentially modifying data, sending requests,
  or consuming resources. The cumulative effect of many individually
  small actions can be devastating.
remediation: >
  Implement configurable limits on the number of tool invocations per
  conversation turn and per session. Set reasonable defaults based on
  expected usage patterns, typically 10-25 calls per turn and 100-500
  per session. Alert the user when limits are approached. Require
  explicit user approval to continue beyond the limit. Track tool call
  counts per server and per tool for anomaly detection.
