title: Unauthorized External Communications
category: agentic_behavior
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP configurations where agents can contact external services,
  APIs, or endpoints that are not part of the approved communication
  set. Unauthorized external communications enable data exfiltration,
  command-and- control channels, and interactions with malicious
  infrastructure.
risk_explanation: >
  Unauthorized external communications from MCP agents create channels
  for data exfiltration and command-and-control. A compromised agent can
  send sensitive data to attacker-controlled servers, download malicious
  payloads, or receive real-time attack instructions through external
  API calls. Without communication controls, there is no boundary
  limiting what an exploited agent can share with external parties.
remediation: >
  Implement an allowlist of approved external endpoints that agents can
  communicate with. Monitor all outbound communications from agents for
  anomalous destinations or patterns. Require user approval for
  communications with new external endpoints. Deploy network-level
  controls that enforce egress restrictions on agent traffic. Log all
  external communications with full request and response details for
  audit.
