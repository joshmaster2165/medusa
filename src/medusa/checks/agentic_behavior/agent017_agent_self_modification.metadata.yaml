title: Agent Self-Modification
category: agentic_behavior
severity: critical
description: >
  Detects MCP configurations where agents can modify their own behavior,
  instructions, safety constraints, or operational parameters through
  tool invocations. Self-modification allows a compromised agent to
  remove its own safety guardrails and operate without constraints.
risk_explanation: >
  Agent self-modification is one of the most severe agentic risks
  because it allows an agent to escalate its own capabilities and remove
  safety constraints. Through MCP tool invocations that modify
  configuration files, environment variables, or system prompts, a
  compromised agent can disable its own safety guardrails, grant itself
  additional permissions, and modify its operational parameters. Once
  self-modified, the agent operates without the controls that were
  designed to limit its behavior.
remediation: >
  Prevent agents from modifying their own configuration, system prompts,
  or safety constraints through tool invocations. Implement read-only
  access to agent configuration from the agent's perspective. Use
  immutable safety constraints that cannot be altered at runtime. Detect
  and block tool invocations that target the agent's own operational
  parameters. Implement integrity monitoring that detects unauthorized
  changes to agent configuration.
