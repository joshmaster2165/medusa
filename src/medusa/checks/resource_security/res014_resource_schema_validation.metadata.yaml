title: Missing Resource Schema Validation
category: resource_security
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP resources that lack schema definitions or validation for
  their content structure. Without schema validation, resources can
  contain unexpected fields, malformed data, or additional properties
  that may be processed in unintended ways by consumers.
risk_explanation: >
  Missing schema validation allows attackers to inject additional fields
  or malformed content into resources that clients process without
  verification. Extra properties may override expected values, inject
  instructions into LLM processing, or exploit parser vulnerabilities in
  downstream consumers. Malformed data can cause application errors or
  undefined behavior.
remediation: >
  Define JSON Schema or equivalent validation schemas for all resource
  types. Validate resource content against its schema before serving to
  clients. Reject resources that fail validation with clear error
  messages. Use strict schema validation that rejects unknown additional
  properties by default.
