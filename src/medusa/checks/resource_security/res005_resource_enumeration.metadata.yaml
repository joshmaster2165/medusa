title: Resource Enumeration Risk
category: resource_security
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that expose predictable or sequential resource
  identifiers, enabling attackers to enumerate all available resources
  by iterating through ID ranges or patterns. Resource listing endpoints
  without pagination limits also enable bulk enumeration.
risk_explanation: >
  Predictable resource identifiers allow attackers to discover and
  access resources they were not intended to see, including other users
  data, internal configuration resources, and administrative resources.
  Enumeration is often the first step in a data exfiltration attack
  where all discoverable resources are harvested.
remediation: >
  Use non-sequential, non-predictable identifiers for resources such as
  UUIDs or cryptographic hashes. Implement pagination with reasonable
  limits on resource listing endpoints. Add rate limiting to resource
  listing and access operations to slow enumeration attempts. Require
  authorization for resource listing.
