title: Missing Resource Origin Validation
category: resource_security
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP resources that fetch or proxy content from external
  origins without validating the source. Resources that pull data from
  user-specified URLs, external APIs, or remote file systems without
  origin validation enable SSRF and data poisoning attacks.
risk_explanation: >
  Missing origin validation allows attackers to point resource URIs at
  internal services, cloud metadata endpoints such as 169.254.169.254,
  or attacker-controlled servers. This enables server-side request
  forgery to access internal networks, exfiltrate data to external
  servers, or inject malicious content through attacker-controlled
  resource origins.
remediation: >
  Implement strict origin validation with an allowlist of permitted
  external hosts and protocols. Block access to internal network ranges
  and cloud metadata endpoints. Validate DNS resolution to prevent DNS
  rebinding attacks. Use network-level controls to restrict outbound
  connections from the MCP server.
