title: Missing Resource Content Validation
category: resource_security
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP resources that serve content without validating or
  sanitizing it before delivery to clients. Unsanitized resource content
  may contain malicious payloads such as prompt injection strings,
  script tags, or encoded attack sequences.
risk_explanation: >
  Resources that return unsanitized content can be weaponized to inject
  malicious instructions into the LLM context. An attacker who can
  modify a resource target such as a file or database record can embed
  prompt injection payloads that the LLM will process as instructions,
  potentially leading to unauthorized actions.
remediation: >
  Implement content validation and sanitization for all resources before
  they are returned to clients. Scan resource content for known
  injection patterns. Apply content security policies that restrict the
  types of content that can be served. Tag resource content with its
  trust level for downstream processing.
