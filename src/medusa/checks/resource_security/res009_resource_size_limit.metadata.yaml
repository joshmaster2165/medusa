title: Missing Resource Size Limit
category: resource_security
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP resource handlers that do not enforce size limits on
  resource content, allowing extremely large resources to be requested
  and processed. This can exhaust server memory, consume excessive
  bandwidth, and overwhelm the LLM context window.
risk_explanation: >
  Without size limits, an attacker can request very large resources that
  consume all available server memory, causing denial of service. Large
  resources injected into the LLM context can displace important
  instructions, overwhelm token limits, and increase processing costs.
  Resource size amplification attacks can also saturate network
  bandwidth.
remediation: >
  Implement configurable maximum size limits for all resource types.
  Stream large resources with chunking rather than loading them entirely
  into memory. Return appropriate error responses when size limits are
  exceeded. Set per-client bandwidth quotas for resource access.
  Truncate oversized resources with clear indicators.
