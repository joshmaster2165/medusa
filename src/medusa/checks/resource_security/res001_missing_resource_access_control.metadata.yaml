title: Missing Resource Access Control
category: resource_security
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP resource endpoints that lack access control checks,
  allowing any authenticated or unauthenticated client to read, list, or
  subscribe to resources without authorization verification. Resources
  may contain sensitive data that should be restricted by role or scope.
risk_explanation: >
  Without access control on resources, any MCP client can access all
  exposed data including configuration files, database contents, and
  internal documents. An attacker who connects a malicious client can
  exfiltrate all server resources. This is especially dangerous when
  resources expose file system contents or database records.
remediation: >
  Implement resource-level access control that validates client
  authorization before returning resource content. Define access
  policies per resource URI pattern. Use the MCP session context to
  enforce per-user or per-role restrictions. Deny access by default and
  require explicit grants for each resource.
