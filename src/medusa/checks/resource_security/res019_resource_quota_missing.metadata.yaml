title: Missing Resource Quota
category: resource_security
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that do not enforce quotas on resource creation,
  storage, or access frequency per client. Without quotas, a single
  client can monopolize server resources, starving other clients and
  causing denial of service through resource exhaustion.
risk_explanation: >
  Missing resource quotas enable a single client or attacker to consume
  all available server resources including storage space, memory for
  active resources, and processing capacity for resource operations.
  This prevents legitimate clients from accessing the server and can
  cause cascading failures across all connected clients.
remediation: >
  Implement per-client quotas for resource creation count, total storage
  size, and access frequency. Set sensible default quotas and allow
  administrators to configure per-client limits. Return clear error
  messages when quotas are exceeded. Monitor quota usage and alert on
  clients approaching their limits.
