title: Resource Subscription Abuse
category: resource_security
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP resource subscription endpoints that lack rate limiting,
  maximum subscription counts, or client validation. Uncontrolled
  subscriptions can exhaust server resources through notification
  flooding or enable unauthorized real-time data monitoring.
risk_explanation: >
  Without subscription controls, an attacker can create thousands of
  subscriptions to resource updates, overwhelming the server with
  notification processing. Excessive subscriptions consume memory, CPU,
  and network bandwidth. Unrestricted subscriptions also allow attackers
  to monitor all resource changes in real-time, enabling data
  surveillance and timing attacks.
remediation: >
  Implement per-client subscription limits with configurable maximums.
  Add rate limiting on subscription creation and notification delivery.
  Require authorization for subscribing to sensitive resources. Monitor
  subscription counts and alert on anomalous patterns. Clean up stale
  subscriptions automatically.
