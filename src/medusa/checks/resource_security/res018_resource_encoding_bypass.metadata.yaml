title: Resource Encoding Bypass
category: resource_security
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP resource handlers that fail to properly handle character
  encoding variations, allowing attackers to bypass content filters and
  access controls using alternative encodings such as UTF-7, UTF-16,
  double URL encoding, or mixed encoding schemes.
risk_explanation: >
  Encoding bypass attacks exploit differences between how the security
  filter decodes input and how the backend processes it. An attacker can
  encode malicious payloads in alternative character sets to evade
  content validation, inject path traversal sequences through double
  encoding, or bypass keyword-based filters using homoglyph characters
  from different Unicode blocks.
remediation: >
  Normalize all resource content to a single canonical encoding such as
  UTF-8 before applying any security checks. Reject requests with
  ambiguous or unsupported encodings. Decode content fully before
  validation, including handling of double encoding. Use encoding-aware
  comparison functions for access control decisions.
