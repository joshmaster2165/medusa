title: Dynamic Resource Injection
category: resource_security
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP servers that allow dynamic registration of new resources
  at runtime without validation or authorization. Dynamically injected
  resources can introduce malicious content into the server resource
  pool, poisoning the data available to LLM clients.
risk_explanation: >
  Dynamic resource injection allows an attacker with limited access to
  register new resources containing prompt injection payloads,
  misleading data, or malicious content. These injected resources appear
  as legitimate server resources and may be automatically included in
  LLM context, enabling indirect prompt injection and data manipulation
  without modifying existing resources.
remediation: >
  Restrict dynamic resource registration to authorized administrators
  only. Implement content validation and approval workflows for new
  resources. Sign resources to verify their origin and integrity.
  Monitor for unexpected resource registrations and alert on anomalies.
  Maintain an audit log of all resource lifecycle operations.
