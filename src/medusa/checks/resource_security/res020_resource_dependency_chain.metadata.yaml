title: Resource Dependency Chain Risk
category: resource_security
severity: high
description: >
  Detects MCP resources that form dependency chains where one resource
  references or includes another, creating potential for circular
  dependencies, infinite resolution loops, and cascading access control
  bypasses through transitive resource references.
risk_explanation: >
  Resource dependency chains can be exploited to create circular
  references that cause infinite loops and server crashes. Transitive
  dependencies may bypass access controls when a protected resource is
  included by reference in an unprotected resource. Deep dependency
  chains amplify the impact of poisoning a single resource, as the
  malicious content propagates through all dependent resources.
remediation: >
  Implement dependency chain depth limits and circular dependency
  detection for all resources. Enforce access controls at each level of
  resource resolution, not just the top-level request. Validate resource
  references at registration time to prevent circular dependencies.
  Monitor and log resource dependency chains for security analysis.
