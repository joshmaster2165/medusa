title: Missing Resource Lifetime Management
category: resource_security
severity: medium
description: >
  Detects MCP resources that lack explicit lifetime management,
  including expiration, cleanup, and invalidation mechanisms. Resources
  without lifecycle controls may persist indefinitely, accumulate stale
  data, and consume storage without bound.
risk_explanation: >
  Resources without lifetime management accumulate over time, consuming
  server storage and memory. Stale resources may contain outdated access
  tokens, expired credentials, or obsolete data that should have been
  purged. Attackers can exploit long-lived resources to access data that
  should have been deleted or to overwhelm the server with resource
  accumulation.
remediation: >
  Implement resource expiration policies with configurable time-to-live
  values. Add automatic cleanup for expired resources. Provide resource
  invalidation mechanisms that cascade to dependent resources. Monitor
  resource counts and storage usage with alerts for abnormal growth.
  Document expected resource lifetimes for each resource type.
