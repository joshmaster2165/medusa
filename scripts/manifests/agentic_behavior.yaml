    title: "Missing Human-in-the-Loop"
    severity: high
    description: >
      Detects MCP server configurations where destructive or irreversible tool
      invocations can be executed without requiring explicit user confirmation.
      Actions such as file deletion, database modification, sending emails, or
      executing system commands should require a human approval step before
      proceeding.
    risk_explanation: >
      Without human-in-the-loop controls, an LLM agent connected to MCP servers
      can autonomously execute destructive actions based on misunderstood
      instructions, prompt injection, or model hallucination. A single erroneous
      tool invocation can delete data, send unauthorized communications, modify
      production systems, or commit financial transactions without the user's
      knowledge or consent. The speed of autonomous execution prevents timely
      intervention.
    remediation: >
      Implement a confirmation mechanism that requires explicit user approval for
      destructive or high-impact tool invocations. Categorize tools by risk level
      and require confirmation for medium and high-risk operations. Display the
      full tool invocation details including parameters and expected effects before
      requesting approval. Implement a timeout for approval requests that defaults
      to denial if not answered.

    title: "Autonomous Action Risk"
    severity: high
    description: >
      Detects MCP server deployments where the LLM agent can take actions in the
      real world without user approval. This includes sending network requests,
      modifying files, interacting with external APIs, or executing commands
      autonomously based solely on the LLM's interpretation of the user's intent.
    risk_explanation: >
      Autonomous actions by LLM agents connected to MCP servers carry significant
      risk because LLMs can misinterpret instructions, hallucinate actions, or be
      manipulated through prompt injection. Without approval gates, a compromised
      agent can cause widespread damage across all connected tools and services
      before the user becomes aware. The autonomous nature of these actions means
      they can chain together, amplifying the impact.
    remediation: >
      Implement an action approval framework that categorizes tool invocations by
      risk level and requires user approval for actions above a configurable
      threshold. Provide a preview of the planned action including affected
      resources and potential consequences. Support both synchronous approval
      (blocking until approved) and asynchronous notification. Allow users to
      configure auto-approval rules for trusted, low-risk operations.

    slug: agent_loop_detection
    title: "Agent Loop Detection"
    severity: medium
    description: >
      Detects MCP configurations that lack detection and prevention mechanisms for
      infinite tool invocation loops. Without loop detection, an LLM agent can
      repeatedly invoke the same tool or cycle through a set of tools indefinitely,
      consuming resources and potentially causing unintended side effects.
    risk_explanation: >
      Agent loops occur when the LLM enters a cycle of tool invocations where the
      output of one tool triggers another, which eventually triggers the first
      tool again. These loops can consume API quotas, exhaust server resources,
      generate excessive costs, and produce unintended side effects through
      repeated tool executions. Loops may also indicate prompt injection attacks
      designed to maximize resource consumption or repeated data exfiltration.
    remediation: >
      Implement loop detection that identifies repeated patterns in tool invocation
      sequences. Set a maximum number of tool invocations per conversation turn
      and per session. Track tool invocation history and detect cycles in the
      invocation graph. Implement a circuit breaker that halts execution when loop
      patterns are detected. Alert the user when potential loops are identified
      and require manual intervention to continue.

    severity: high
    description: >
      Detects MCP configurations that do not monitor for multi-step attack chains
      where individually benign tool invocations combine to form a malicious
      sequence. An attacker can use prompt injection to guide the agent through a
      series of steps that collectively achieve a harmful outcome.
    risk_explanation: >
      Multi-step attack chains are particularly dangerous because each individual
      tool invocation may appear legitimate when reviewed in isolation. For
      example, reading a configuration file, extracting a database URL, connecting
      to the database, and exporting data are each normal operations that together
      constitute a data breach. Without chain analysis, these attacks bypass
      per-tool security controls and exploit the agent's ability to compose
      actions autonomously.
    remediation: >
      Implement behavioral analysis that monitors sequences of tool invocations
      for suspicious patterns. Define rules that detect known attack patterns such
      as read-credentials-then-connect or enumerate-then-exfiltrate. Use anomaly
      detection to identify unusual tool invocation sequences. Log complete
      invocation chains for forensic analysis. Implement step-level approval for
      chains that trigger security rules.

    title: "Delegation Without Authorization"
    severity: high
    description: >
      Detects MCP configurations where one LLM agent can delegate tasks to other
      agents or sub-agents without proper authorization checks. In multi-agent
      architectures, delegation without authorization allows a compromised agent
      to leverage other agents' capabilities and access rights.
    risk_explanation: >
      Unauthorized delegation in multi-agent MCP systems allows a compromised or
      manipulated agent to recruit other agents to perform actions on its behalf.
      The delegated agents may have different permission sets, access to different
      MCP servers, or higher privilege levels. This creates a privilege escalation
      path where a low-privilege agent can achieve high-privilege outcomes by
      delegating to more capable agents without proper authorization verification.
    remediation: >
      Implement authorization checks for all agent delegation requests. Verify
      that the delegating agent has permission to request the specific actions
      being delegated. Maintain delegation chains and enforce depth limits.
      Require the same user approval for delegated actions as for directly
      invoked actions. Log all delegation events including the delegating agent,
      target agent, and requested actions.

    title: "Tool Selection Manipulation"
    severity: high
    description: >
      Detects MCP configurations where the agent's tool selection process can be
      manipulated through crafted tool descriptions, misleading names, or prompt
      injection in tool metadata. An attacker can influence which tool the agent
      selects for a given task, redirecting actions to a malicious or compromised
      tool.
    risk_explanation: >
      Tool selection manipulation exploits the LLM's reliance on tool descriptions
      and names to choose which tool to invoke. A malicious MCP server can craft
      tool descriptions that make a dangerous tool appear suitable for common
      tasks, or shadow a legitimate tool's name to intercept invocations. This
      causes the agent to invoke the wrong tool, sending user data to malicious
      endpoints or executing unintended operations.
    remediation: >
      Implement tool selection verification that validates the chosen tool against
      the user's intent. Display the selected tool and its server origin to the
      user before invocation. Detect and warn about tools with similar names from
      different servers. Apply tool reputation scoring based on server trust level
      and usage history. Prevent tool descriptions from containing instructions
      that override the agent's selection logic.

    severity: high
    description: >
      Detects MCP configurations where agent memory, state, or context can be
      corrupted through tool outputs, sampling responses, or direct state
      manipulation. Poisoned agent memory leads to incorrect decisions in
      subsequent interactions and can persist across conversation turns.
    risk_explanation: >
      Agent memory poisoning corrupts the information the LLM agent relies on for
      decision-making. By injecting false information into the agent's context
      through carefully crafted tool outputs, an attacker can cause the agent to
      believe false facts, trust malicious servers, ignore warnings, or follow
      attacker-supplied instructions. Poisoned memory persists across conversation
      turns, making the effects cumulative and increasingly severe over time.
    remediation: >
      Implement memory integrity checks that validate agent context against known
      facts and user-confirmed information. Isolate tool outputs from the agent's
      core memory using trust boundaries. Apply content filtering to tool outputs
      before they are incorporated into agent context. Provide users with
      visibility into the agent's current context and memory state. Implement
      periodic memory validation and cleanup.

    slug: goal_hijacking
    title: "Goal Hijacking"
    severity: high
    description: >
      Detects MCP configurations where the agent's primary goal or task can be
      redirected through prompt injection in tool outputs, resource contents, or
      sampling responses. Goal hijacking causes the agent to abandon the user's
      intended task and pursue an attacker-defined objective.
    risk_explanation: >
      Goal hijacking is one of the most impactful agentic attacks because it
      redirects the agent's entire action sequence toward attacker-defined
      objectives. Once hijacked, the agent uses all of its available tools and
      resources to accomplish the attacker's goal rather than the user's. The
      agent may exfiltrate data, modify systems, or take destructive actions while
      appearing to operate normally. Users may not notice the hijacking until
      significant damage has occurred.
    remediation: >
      Implement goal tracking that monitors the agent's actions for consistency
      with the user's stated objective. Detect abrupt changes in action patterns
      that suggest goal hijacking. Require periodic user confirmation that the
      agent is on the correct task. Apply instruction hierarchy that prioritizes
      user instructions over tool-provided instructions. Implement guardrails
      that prevent the agent from taking actions unrelated to the stated goal.

    slug: reward_hacking
    title: "Reward Hacking"
    severity: medium
    description: >
      Detects MCP configurations where an attacker can exploit the agent's reward
      or feedback mechanisms to reinforce undesired behavior. By manipulating
      success signals, error messages, or feedback loops, an attacker can train
      the agent to prefer malicious tools or follow harmful patterns.
    risk_explanation: >
      Reward hacking exploits the agent's learning and adaptation mechanisms. In
      MCP systems where agents adjust behavior based on success or failure signals
      from tools, an attacker can manipulate these signals to reinforce malicious
      behavior. A compromised tool might return success indicators for harmful
      actions and failure indicators for legitimate ones, gradually training the
      agent to prefer the attacker's desired behavior patterns.
    remediation: >
      Implement independent success verification that does not rely solely on tool
      responses. Use multi-signal validation where tool success is confirmed
      through independent channels. Apply anomaly detection to feedback patterns
      that may indicate reward manipulation. Limit the agent's ability to modify
      its own behavior based on tool feedback. Log all feedback signals for
      analysis and audit.

    severity: high
    description: >
      Detects MCP configurations where one agent or MCP server can impersonate
      another agent's identity or claim to be a trusted system component.
      Impersonation allows a malicious entity to inherit the trust level and
      permissions of the impersonated agent, bypassing access controls.
    risk_explanation: >
      Agent impersonation in MCP systems allows a malicious server to present
      itself as a trusted agent, inheriting permissions and trust relationships
      that were not legitimately granted. In multi-agent architectures, this
      enables unauthorized access to tools, resources, and data that are reserved
      for the impersonated agent. Users cannot distinguish between the legitimate
      agent and the impostor, making this attack difficult to detect.
    remediation: >
      Implement cryptographic identity verification for all agents in the MCP
      system. Use mutual TLS or signed identity tokens to authenticate agent
      identities. Prevent MCP servers from claiming arbitrary agent identities.
      Verify agent identity at each interaction point rather than relying on
      initial authentication. Implement identity attestation that is verified by
      the LLM client before granting access.

    severity: medium
    description: >
      Detects MCP configurations that do not limit the number of tool invocations
      an agent can make within a single conversation turn or session. Without
      bounds, an agent can make an unlimited number of tool calls, consuming
      resources and potentially causing cumulative harm through repeated actions.
    risk_explanation: >
      Unbounded tool call counts allow an agent to execute an arbitrary number of
      operations in a single turn, leading to resource exhaustion, excessive costs,
      and potential cumulative harm. A prompt injection attack can instruct the
      agent to invoke tools hundreds or thousands of times, each invocation
      potentially modifying data, sending requests, or consuming resources. The
      cumulative effect of many individually small actions can be devastating.
    remediation: >
      Implement configurable limits on the number of tool invocations per
      conversation turn and per session. Set reasonable defaults based on expected
      usage patterns, typically 10-25 calls per turn and 100-500 per session.
      Alert the user when limits are approached. Require explicit user approval
      to continue beyond the limit. Track tool call counts per server and per
      tool for anomaly detection.

    severity: high
    description: >
      Detects MCP configurations where agents maintain state, context, or
      behavioral modifications beyond the current session. Persistent agent state
      can carry compromised configurations, poisoned memories, or attacker-
      injected instructions across sessions, affecting future interactions.
    risk_explanation: >
      Agent persistence allows the effects of an attack to survive session
      boundaries. If an agent's memory, preferences, or learned behaviors persist
      across sessions, a prompt injection attack in one session can influence the
      agent's behavior in all future sessions. This creates a persistent
      compromise that survives the typical remediation step of starting a new
      session. Poisoned persistent state can continuously redirect the agent toward
      attacker objectives without the user's knowledge.
    remediation: >
      Implement session isolation that prevents agent state from persisting across
      sessions by default. If persistence is required, validate persisted state
      before loading it in new sessions. Apply integrity checks to persisted
      agent memory and discard entries that fail validation. Provide users with
      visibility into and control over persisted agent state. Implement periodic
      state review and cleanup processes.

    severity: high
    description: >
      Detects MCP configurations where an agent gradually accumulates permissions,
      tool access, or resource privileges over the course of a session or across
      sessions. Capability accumulation violates the principle of least privilege
      by granting the agent more access than needed for any single task.
    risk_explanation: >
      Capability accumulation creates a growing attack surface as the agent gains
      access to more tools, resources, and permissions over time. Each new
      capability increases the potential damage from a compromise. A prompt
      injection attack is more damaging when the agent has accumulated access to
      file systems, databases, external APIs, and administrative tools than when
      it has access to only the tools needed for the current task. Accumulated
      capabilities also increase the value of session hijacking.
    remediation: >
      Implement dynamic capability management that grants tools and permissions
      only for the current task and revokes them when the task is complete. Apply
      the principle of least privilege by starting each interaction with minimal
      capabilities. Require explicit user approval for capability grants that
      exceed the current task scope. Track and display the agent's current
      capability set to the user. Implement capability expiration timers.

    description: >
      Detects MCP configurations where tool outputs can contain prompt injection
      payloads that alter the agent's behavior. When tools return data from
      external sources such as web pages, files, or databases, this data may
      contain hidden instructions that the LLM interprets as commands.
    risk_explanation: >
      Indirect prompt injection via MCP tools is one of the most critical risks in
      agentic systems. Tool outputs containing attacker-controlled content from
      web pages, emails, documents, or databases can embed instructions that the
      LLM follows without user awareness. This enables goal hijacking, data
      exfiltration, unauthorized tool invocations, and complete compromise of the
      agent's actions. The attack is especially dangerous because tool outputs
      are typically treated as trusted data.
    remediation: >
      Treat all tool outputs as untrusted content that may contain prompt injection
      payloads. Implement output sanitization that strips or neutralizes potential
      injection patterns in tool responses. Use content separation techniques that
      distinguish between data and instructions in the agent's context. Apply
      instruction hierarchy that prevents tool-provided instructions from
      overriding user instructions. Monitor for behavioral changes after

      Detects MCP configurations where agents collect, store, or retain more data
      than necessary for their current task. Data hoarding increases the value of
      a compromised session and violates data minimization principles required by
      privacy regulations.
    risk_explanation: >
      Agents that accumulate unnecessary data in their context create a high-value
      target for attackers. If the agent's context contains credentials, PII,
      financial data, or proprietary information from previous tool invocations,
      a single prompt injection attack can exfiltrate all of this accumulated
      data. Data hoarding also creates privacy compliance risks as the agent
      retains personal information beyond the minimum required for task completion.
    remediation: >
      Implement data minimization policies that limit the information retained in
      the agent's context. Clear tool outputs from the context after they have
      been processed and are no longer needed. Apply data classification to tool
      outputs and enforce retention limits based on sensitivity. Implement context
      pruning that removes sensitive data after use. Provide users with visibility

      Unauthorized external communications enable data exfiltration, command-and-
      control channels, and interactions with malicious infrastructure.
    risk_explanation: >
      Unauthorized external communications from MCP agents create channels for
      data exfiltration and command-and-control. A compromised agent can send
      sensitive data to attacker-controlled servers, download malicious payloads,
      or receive real-time attack instructions through external API calls. Without

      agent can share with external parties.
    remediation: >
      Implement an allowlist of approved external endpoints that agents can
      communicate with. Monitor all outbound communications from agents for
      anomalous destinations or patterns. Require user approval for communications
      with new external endpoints. Deploy network-level controls that enforce

      invocations. Self-modification allows a compromised agent to remove its own
      safety guardrails and operate without constraints.
    risk_explanation: >
      Agent self-modification is one of the most severe agentic risks because it
      allows an agent to escalate its own capabilities and remove safety
      constraints. Through MCP tool invocations that modify configuration files,
      environment variables, or system prompts, a compromised agent can disable
      its own safety guardrails, grant itself additional permissions, and modify
      its operational parameters. Once self-modified, the agent operates without
      the controls that were designed to limit its behavior.
    remediation: >
      Prevent agents from modifying their own configuration, system prompts, or
      safety constraints through tool invocations. Implement read-only access to
      agent configuration from the agent's perspective. Use immutable safety
      constraints that cannot be altered at runtime. Detect and block tool
      invocations that target the agent's own operational parameters. Implement

    severity: high
    description: >
      Detects MCP configurations involving multiple agents that communicate or
      coordinate without adequate security controls. In multi-agent systems, one
      compromised agent can influence, manipulate, or attack other agents through
      inter-agent communication channels.
    risk_explanation: >
      Multi-agent coordination introduces risks where a single compromised agent
      can propagate attacks to other agents in the system. Through inter-agent
      communication, a malicious agent can inject prompts into other agents'
      contexts, manipulate shared state, coordinate distributed attacks, and
      create a network of compromised agents. The trust relationships between
      agents amplify the impact because agents may accept instructions from peers
      without the same scrutiny applied to external inputs.
    remediation: >
      Implement authentication and authorization for all inter-agent communication.
      Apply the same security scrutiny to messages from other agents as to
      external inputs. Use message signing to verify the identity and integrity
      of inter-agent messages. Implement isolation between agents that prevents
      one agent from accessing another's context or tools. Monitor inter-agent
      communication for anomalous patterns. Limit the scope of actions agents can
      request from each other.

    slug: agent_resource_exhaustion
    title: "Agent Resource Exhaustion"
    severity: medium
    description: >
      Detects MCP configurations where agents can consume excessive computational
      resources including CPU, memory, disk, network bandwidth, and API quotas
      through unrestricted tool invocations. Resource exhaustion degrades or
      denies service for all users of the MCP infrastructure.
    risk_explanation: >
      Agent resource exhaustion can be triggered by prompt injection attacks that
      instruct the agent to invoke resource-intensive tools repeatedly. This
      affects not only the attacker's session but potentially all users sharing
      the MCP infrastructure. Exhaustion of API quotas can block legitimate
      operations, memory exhaustion can crash servers, and CPU exhaustion can
      degrade performance for all sessions. The agent's autonomy amplifies the
      impact because it can continuously request resources without human
      intervention.
    remediation: >
      Implement resource budgets for each agent session including limits on CPU
      time, memory usage, disk space, network bandwidth, and API call counts.
      Monitor resource consumption in real time and terminate sessions that exceed
      budgets. Implement per-tool resource limits that prevent any single tool
      invocation from consuming excessive resources. Use isolation mechanisms such
      as containers or sandboxes to enforce resource limits at the infrastructure
      level.

    slug: missing_agent_audit_trail
    title: "Missing Agent Audit Trail"
    severity: medium
    description: >
      Detects MCP configurations that lack comprehensive audit logging of agent
      decisions, tool selections, invocation parameters, and outcomes. Without
      audit trails, it is impossible to investigate security incidents, detect
      anomalous behavior, or demonstrate compliance with security policies.
    risk_explanation: >
      Missing agent audit trails prevent organizations from detecting, investigating,
      and responding to security incidents in MCP agentic systems. Without logs of
      agent decisions and tool invocations, a compromised agent can operate
      undetected for extended periods. Post-incident forensics cannot determine
      what data was accessed, what actions were taken, or how the compromise
      occurred. This also prevents compliance with regulations that require
      detailed audit records of automated decision-making.
    remediation: >
      Implement comprehensive audit logging that records all agent decisions
      including tool selections, invocation parameters, tool outputs, and
      decision rationale. Log the full context available to the agent at each
      decision point. Store audit logs in a tamper-resistant, centralized log
      store with appropriate retention periods. Implement real-time monitoring
      and alerting on suspicious patterns in agent audit logs. Ensure logs
      contain sufficient detail for forensic reconstruction of agent sessions.
