    title: "Missing Security Policy"
    severity: medium
    description: >
      Detects MCP server deployments that lack a documented security policy
      defining security requirements, controls, and responsibilities for the
      MCP server and its integrations. A security policy establishes the baseline
      for secure operation and communicates expectations to all stakeholders.
    risk_explanation: >
      Without a documented security policy, MCP server deployments operate without
      defined security requirements or accountability. Developers and operators
      make ad-hoc security decisions without consistent guidance, leading to
      gaps in protection. Incident response is hampered because there is no
      reference for expected security posture. Compliance audits cannot assess
      conformance to requirements that do not exist.
    remediation: >
      Create and maintain a comprehensive security policy for the MCP server
      deployment. The policy should define security requirements for authentication,
      authorization, data protection, transport security, logging, and incident
      response. Specify roles and responsibilities for security management. Review
      and update the policy annually or when significant changes occur. Ensure
      all operators and developers acknowledge the policy.

    description: >
      Detects MCP server deployments that lack a privacy policy defining how
      user data, conversation content, tool inputs, and tool outputs are
      collected, processed, stored, and retained. MCP servers often process
      sensitive personal information through LLM interactions and tool invocations.
    risk_explanation: >
      MCP servers process potentially sensitive data through tool invocations and
      LLM interactions, including personal information, business data, and
      conversation contents. Without a privacy policy, there is no defined
      framework for data handling, retention, or user rights. This creates legal
      and regulatory risk, particularly under GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy
      regulations that require transparent data processing practices.
    remediation: >
      Develop a privacy policy that covers all data processed by the MCP server
      including user inputs, tool parameters, tool outputs, conversation history,
      and session metadata. Define data retention periods, data subject rights,
      and data processing lawful bases. Specify how data is shared with LLM
      providers and external services accessed by tools. Make the privacy policy
      accessible to all users and review it regularly for regulatory compliance.

    severity: low
    description: >
      Detects MCP server deployments that lack terms of service defining
      acceptable use, limitations of liability, and user responsibilities. Terms
      of service establish the contractual framework for MCP server usage and
      set expectations for both operators and users.
    risk_explanation: >
      Without terms of service, MCP server operators have no legal framework for
      managing user behavior, limiting liability, or enforcing acceptable use
      policies. Users may misuse the server for purposes it was not designed for,
      abuse tool access in ways that affect other users, or hold the operator
      liable for damages caused by tool invocations. The absence of terms creates
      legal uncertainty for all parties.
    remediation: >
      Develop terms of service that define acceptable use policies for the MCP
      server, including permitted and prohibited actions, liability limitations,
      and service level expectations. Address the unique aspects of MCP server
      usage including tool invocation responsibilities, data processing consent,
      and autonomous agent behavior. Have the terms reviewed by legal counsel
      and require user acceptance before granting access.

    description: >
      Detects MCP server deployments that lack a mapping between security controls
      and applicable compliance frameworks such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST CSF,
      or industry-specific regulations. Compliance mapping demonstrates that
      security controls address regulatory requirements.
    risk_explanation: >
      Without compliance mapping, organizations cannot demonstrate that their MCP
      server deployment meets regulatory requirements. This creates audit failures,
      regulatory fines, and potential legal liability. MCP servers that process
      sensitive data may be subject to multiple compliance frameworks, and without
      a mapping, gaps between implemented controls and required controls remain
      undetected until an audit or security incident reveals them.
    remediation: >
      Create a compliance mapping document that maps each security control
      implemented in the MCP server deployment to the applicable compliance
      framework requirements. Identify gaps where compliance requirements are not
      met by current controls. Prioritize remediation of compliance gaps based on
      regulatory risk. Maintain the mapping as controls and regulations evolve.
      Use automated compliance monitoring tools where available.

    description: >
      Detects MCP server deployments that lack a documented incident response
      plan for security events. Without an incident response plan, organizations
      cannot effectively detect, contain, eradicate, and recover from security
      incidents affecting MCP server operations.
    risk_explanation: >
      MCP servers face unique security risks including prompt injection, tool
      poisoning, session hijacking, and data exfiltration through tool abuse.
      Without an incident response plan tailored to these risks, organizations
      respond to incidents ad-hoc, leading to delayed containment, incomplete
      eradication, lost evidence, and prolonged recovery times. The autonomous
      nature of LLM agents means incidents can escalate rapidly, making
      preparedness critical.
    remediation: >
      Develop an incident response plan that addresses MCP-specific security
      incidents including tool poisoning, prompt injection, session compromise,
      data exfiltration, and agent manipulation. Define incident severity levels,
      escalation procedures, communication plans, and recovery procedures. Include
      specific playbooks for common MCP attack scenarios. Conduct regular incident
      response exercises and update the plan based on lessons learned.

    severity: medium
    description: >
      Detects MCP server deployments that lack a formal change management process
      for tool modifications, server configuration changes, and security policy
      updates. Uncontrolled changes can introduce security vulnerabilities,
      break existing security controls, or disrupt service availability.
    risk_explanation: >
      Without change management, modifications to MCP server tools, configurations,
      and policies are made without review, testing, or approval. This allows
      security vulnerabilities to be introduced through code changes, misconfig-
      urations to weaken security controls, and untested changes to cause service
      disruptions. In MCP environments, a single tool change can affect all
      connected LLM clients and create new attack vectors for prompt injection
      or data exfiltration.
    remediation: >
      Implement a change management process that requires review and approval for
      all changes to MCP server tools, configurations, and security policies.
      Include security review in the change approval process. Test changes in a
      staging environment before production deployment. Maintain a change log with
      rollback procedures. Implement automated testing that validates security
      controls after changes are applied.

    description: >
      Detects MCP server deployments that lack periodic access reviews to verify
      that user permissions, tool access grants, and API keys remain appropriate.
      Without access reviews, permissions accumulate over time and former users
      may retain access they no longer need.
    risk_explanation: >
      Without periodic access reviews, MCP server permissions drift from their
      intended state. Users accumulate tool access they no longer need, former
      employees retain active credentials, and API keys created for temporary
      purposes remain valid indefinitely. This expanded access surface increases
      the risk of unauthorized tool invocations, data access, and privilege
      escalation. Stale credentials are prime targets for attackers.
    remediation: >
      Implement a periodic access review process that audits all user permissions,
      tool access grants, API keys, and service accounts associated with the MCP
      server. Conduct reviews quarterly at minimum. Revoke access for users who
      no longer require it. Rotate long-lived credentials. Implement automated
      access certification workflows that require managers to confirm each user's
      continued need for access.

      Detects MCP server deployments that lack a vulnerability management program
      covering dependency scanning, security patching, and vulnerability
      assessment. MCP servers depend on numerous libraries and frameworks that
      may contain known vulnerabilities.
    risk_explanation: >
      MCP servers depend on LLM client libraries, web frameworks, database drivers,
      and numerous other dependencies that regularly receive security patches.
      Without vulnerability management, known vulnerabilities in these components
      remain unpatched, providing attackers with documented exploitation techniques.
      The MCP protocol specification itself evolves, and without tracking security
      advisories, servers may miss critical protocol-level security fixes.
    remediation: >
      Implement a vulnerability management program that includes automated
      dependency scanning, regular security assessments, and a defined patching
      cadence. Use tools like Dependabot, Snyk, or OWASP Dependency-Check to
      identify known vulnerabilities in MCP server dependencies. Prioritize
      patching based on severity and exploitability. Track MCP protocol security
      advisories and apply relevant fixes. Conduct periodic penetration testing
      focused on MCP-specific attack vectors.

      Detects MCP server deployments that lack a data governance framework
      defining data ownership, classification, handling requirements, and
      lifecycle management for data processed through tool invocations and
      LLM interactions.
    risk_explanation: >
      Without data governance, organizations cannot ensure that data processed by
      MCP servers is handled appropriately. Different types of data (PII,
      financial data, health records, proprietary information) require different
      handling controls, but without classification and governance, all data
      receives the same minimal treatment. This leads to regulatory violations,
      data breaches, and loss of customer trust when sensitive data is inadequately
      protected.
    remediation: >
      Establish a data governance framework that defines data classification
      levels, ownership, handling requirements, and retention policies for all
      data processed by the MCP server. Classify tools by the sensitivity of
      data they process and apply appropriate controls. Implement data lineage
      tracking that records how data flows through tool invocations. Define data
      retention and deletion policies. Appoint data stewards responsible for
      governance compliance.

    severity: high
    description: >
      Detects MCP server deployments that integrate with external MCP servers,
      APIs, or services without performing third-party risk assessments. External
      integrations introduce supply chain risks including data exposure to third
      parties and dependency on their security posture.
    risk_explanation: >
      MCP servers often connect to external services through tool invocations,
      including cloud APIs, SaaS platforms, and third-party MCP servers. Each
      external integration introduces risk from the third party's security
      posture, data handling practices, and operational reliability. Without
      risk assessment, organizations accept unknown risks from every external
      integration, potentially exposing sensitive data to parties that do not
      meet their security requirements.
    remediation: >
      Conduct third-party risk assessments for all external services integrated
      with the MCP server. Evaluate each third party's security certifications,
      data handling practices, incident response capabilities, and business
      continuity plans. Require security questionnaires or SOC 2 reports from
      critical third parties. Implement data minimization for third-party
      interactions. Review third-party risk assessments annually and when
      significant changes occur.

      Detects MCP server deployments that lack a business continuity plan for
      maintaining MCP server operations during disruptions including infrastructure
      failures, security incidents, and service provider outages.
    risk_explanation: >
      MCP servers may become critical infrastructure for organizations that depend
      on them for automated workflows, data processing, and business operations.
      Without a business continuity plan, disruptions to the MCP server cause
      unplanned downtime, data loss, and business process failures. The
      interconnected nature of MCP tool invocations means a single service
      disruption can cascade across multiple dependent workflows.
    remediation: >
      Develop a business continuity plan that addresses MCP server availability
      requirements including maximum tolerable downtime, recovery point objectives,
      and failover procedures. Identify critical tool dependencies and plan for
      their unavailability. Implement redundancy for critical MCP server components.
      Define communication procedures for service disruptions. Test the continuity
      plan regularly through tabletop exercises and failover drills.

      restoring service after catastrophic events including data center failures,
      ransomware attacks, and data corruption. Disaster recovery ensures the
      ability to restore MCP server operations from a known good state.
    risk_explanation: >
      Without disaster recovery planning, catastrophic events affecting the MCP
      server infrastructure can result in permanent data loss, extended outages,
      and inability to restore service. MCP servers may store critical
      configuration, tool definitions, user data, and audit logs that must be
      recoverable. Ransomware attacks targeting MCP infrastructure can encrypt
      all server data and configurations, requiring restoration from backups
      that may not exist without a disaster recovery plan.
    remediation: >
      Develop a disaster recovery plan that includes backup and restoration
      procedures for all MCP server components including configurations, tool
      definitions, user data, and audit logs. Define recovery time objectives
      (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO). Implement automated backups with
      off-site storage. Test disaster recovery procedures regularly through
      restoration drills. Maintain runbooks for common disaster scenarios.

      (SLAs) specifying availability targets, performance requirements, and
      support response times. SLAs set expectations for service quality and
      provide a framework for measuring and reporting on operational performance.
    risk_explanation: >
      Without SLAs, there are no measurable commitments for MCP server
      availability, performance, or support. Users and dependent systems have no
      basis for planning around MCP server reliability. Performance degradation
      goes unmeasured and unreported because there are no defined thresholds.
      This creates a disconnect between user expectations and actual service
      delivery that manifests as user dissatisfaction and unplanned workflow
      disruptions.
    remediation: >
      Define SLAs for the MCP server deployment including availability targets
      (such as 99.9% uptime), response time requirements (such as less than 200ms
      p95), and support response times for different severity levels. Implement
      monitoring that measures SLA compliance continuously. Publish SLA dashboards
      for transparency. Define remediation procedures for SLA violations.

      PCI DSS, HIPAA, or other regulations that impose specific security and
      data handling requirements.
    risk_explanation: >
      Non-compliance with applicable regulations exposes organizations to
      significant financial penalties, legal action, and reputational damage.
      GDPR violations can result in fines up to 4% of global annual revenue.
      HIPAA violations can result in fines up to $1.5 million per violation
      category. MCP servers that process regulated data through tool invocations
      are subject to the same regulatory requirements as any other data processing
      system, and the autonomous nature of LLM agents increases the risk of
      inadvertent violations.
    remediation: >
      Conduct a regulatory assessment to identify all compliance requirements
      applicable to the MCP server deployment based on the types of data
      processed, the jurisdictions involved, and the industry. Map current
      security controls to regulatory requirements and identify gaps. Implement
      remediation plans for compliance gaps with defined timelines. Engage legal
      and compliance teams to validate regulatory interpretations. Maintain
      compliance documentation and undergo regular compliance audits.

      over time, new vulnerabilities go undetected, and compliance drift occurs
      without correction.
    risk_explanation: >
      Security controls are not static; they degrade over time due to
      configuration drift, software updates, changing threat landscapes, and
      operational pressures. Without scheduled audits, these degradations
      accumulate undetected until a security incident reveals them. MCP servers
      are particularly susceptible because the rapidly evolving MCP ecosystem
      introduces new attack vectors that may not be covered by initial security
      controls.
    remediation: >
      Establish a security audit schedule that includes annual comprehensive
      security assessments, quarterly vulnerability assessments, and monthly
      configuration reviews. Define audit scope to cover MCP-specific security
      controls including tool authentication, input validation, prompt injection
      defenses, and session management. Use both internal and external auditors.

    risk_explanation: >
      Developers and operators who are unaware of MCP-specific security risks
      inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities during development and operations.
      MCP security threats such as tool poisoning, indirect prompt injection,

    risk_explanation: >
      Without an asset inventory, organizations have an incomplete picture of
      their MCP deployment surface. Unknown MCP servers, untracked tool
      integrations, and undocumented dependencies create blind spots in security
      monitoring and vulnerability management. Shadow MCP servers deployed by

      threats. Organizations may over-invest in low-risk areas while leaving
      high-risk threats unaddressed. MCP servers face unique risks that differ
      from traditional web applications, including tool poisoning, prompt
      injection, agentic attacks, and sampling abuse. A risk assessment that does
      not account for these MCP-specific threats produces an incomplete picture
      that leaves critical vulnerabilities unaddressed.
    remediation: >
      Conduct a formal risk assessment for the MCP server deployment that
      identifies MCP-specific threats, evaluates existing vulnerabilities,
      assesses potential business impacts, and prioritizes risks. Use a recognized
      risk assessment framework such as NIST SP 800-30 or ISO 27005. Include
      MCP-specific attack scenarios from the OWASP MCP Top 10. Produce a risk
      register and risk treatment plan. Review and update the risk assessment
      annually or when significant changes occur.

    title: "Missing Data Classification Policy"
    severity: medium
    description: >
      Detects MCP server deployments that lack a data classification policy
      defining sensitivity levels and handling requirements for data processed
      through tool invocations. Without classification, all data receives the
      same handling regardless of sensitivity, leading to either over-protection
      of low-sensitivity data or under-protection of high-sensitivity data.
    risk_explanation: >
      MCP servers process data of varying sensitivity through tool invocations,
      from public web content to highly confidential credentials and personal
      information. Without data classification, security controls cannot be
      applied proportionally. Low-sensitivity data may be over-protected, wasting
      resources, while high-sensitivity data may be under-protected, creating
      breach risk. LLM agents cannot make informed decisions about data handling
      without classification metadata, increasing the risk of inadvertent
      exposure.
    remediation: >
      Define a data classification policy with at least three levels (such as
      public, internal, and confidential) and specify handling requirements for
      each level. Classify tool inputs and outputs by sensitivity. Implement
      technical controls that enforce classification-based handling such as
      encryption requirements, access restrictions, and retention limits. Tag
      data with classification metadata throughout the MCP processing pipeline.
      Train developers and operators on the classification policy.

    title: "Missing Vendor Security Assessment"
    severity: high
    description: >
      Detects MCP server deployments that use third-party MCP servers, tools, or
      LLM providers without conducting vendor security assessments. Third-party
      vendors that process data through MCP integrations must meet security
      requirements commensurate with the sensitivity of the data they handle.
    risk_explanation: >
      Third-party MCP server vendors and tool providers have direct access to
      data flowing through tool invocations and may store, process, or transmit
      this data in ways the organization cannot control. Without vendor security
      assessments, organizations trust vendors with sensitive data based on
      marketing claims rather than verified security practices. A vendor security
      breach can expose all data processed through their MCP servers or tools,
      and the organization bears the regulatory and reputational consequences.
    remediation: >
      Conduct security assessments for all third-party MCP server vendors, tool
      providers, and LLM service providers. Request SOC 2 Type II reports,
      penetration test summaries, and security certifications. Evaluate vendors
      against your organization's security requirements. Include security
      requirements in vendor contracts and service agreements. Conduct annual
      vendor security reviews and require breach notification commitments.
      Maintain a vendor risk register that tracks assessment status and findings.
